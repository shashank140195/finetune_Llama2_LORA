Rasmussen-Encephalitis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:rasmussen encephalitis, sometimes referred to as rasmussen syndrome, is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by chronic progressive inflammation (encephalitis) of one cerebral hemisphere. as a result, the patient usually experiences frequent episodes of uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that cause epileptic seizures (epilepsy), and progressive cerebral destruction. with time, further symptoms may include progressive weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), language problems (if on the left side of the brain) and intellectual disabilities. the exact cause of this disorder is not known. the two leading ideas are that the brain inflammation might be a reaction of a foreign antigen (infection) or an autoimmune disease limited to one side of the brain resulting in brain damage. it occurs mostly, but not always, in children between the ages of two and ten years, and in many patients the course of the disease is most severe during the first 8 to 12 months. after the peak inflammatory response is reached, the progression of this disorder appears to slow or stop and the patient is left with permanent neurological deficits. rasmussen encephalitis mostly affects children ten years of age and younger. it is unusual to affect children under two years of age. adolescents and young adults in much smaller proportions are also affected. there may be a history of some prior mild cold or flu prior to the onset of the seizures. the annual number of new-onset rasmussen has been estimated as 2.4/10,000,000 persons less than or equal to 18 years of age.

Acute-Cholecystitis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:the gallbladder is a small pear shaped organ that stores and concentrates bile used for digestion of fats. bile is a compound composed mainly of cholesterol, bile salts and bilirubin, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder during fasting states.  when food is consumed, it is partially digested by the stomach and enters the small intestine, where bile is released by the gallbladder to aid in the breakdown of fats. gallstones develop when the components of bile, such as cholesterol and bilirubin, remain in the gallbladder and solidify into ""pebble-like"" material. gallstones may lodge in the bile ducts and block the release of bile causing a backup. up to 80% of all gallstones do not cause symptoms but obstruction within the bile ducts can cause gallbladder swelling (distension) and severe pain and tenderness of right side of abdomen and/or back (biliary colic). if the obstruction persists, it results in inflammation, infection, and even lack of blood flow (ischemia), a common condition known as acute cholecystitis, or acute calculous cholecystitis (acc).  repeated mild episodes of acute cholecystitis may result in chronic cholecystitis, causing thickening and shrinking of the gallbladder wall resulting in an inability to store bile.

document:cchs is a rare disorder that affects females and males in equal numbers. though the mutation is already present before birth, in milder cases the diagnosis may be missed until after the newborn period. some affected individuals will not be identified until after receiving sedation, anesthesia, or anti-seizure medications, making it especially important to educate health care personnel about cchs and to have a high index of suspicion for considering a diagnosis of cchs. as of 2013, more than 1,000 cases are known worldwide. the birth prevalence of cchs has been extrapolated from incidence figures and general birth rates, but the true prevalence is unknown as culturally diverse large population based studies have not been reported. because the milder cases of cchs may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to estimate the true frequency of cchs in the general population, though the anticipation is far greater than the current estimate.

Asherman_s-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:asherman's syndrome is an uncommon, acquired, gynecological disorder characterized by changes in the menstrual cycle. patients experience reduced menstrual flow, increased cramping and abdominal pain, eventual cessation of menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), and, in many instances, infertility. most often these symptoms are the result of severe inflammation of the lining of the uterus (endometriosis) that is caused by the development of bands of scar tissue that join parts of the walls of the uterus to one another, thus reducing the volume of the uterine cavity (intrauterine adhesions and synechiae).  endometrial scarring and intrauterine adhesions may occur as a result of surgical scraping or cleaning of tissue from the uterine wall (dilatation and curettage [d and c]), infections of the endometrium (e.g., tuberculosis), or other factors. asherman's syndrome is limited to females. unless the physician is careful, the diagnosis of asherman's syndrome may be needlessly overlooked. a simple x-ray of the uterus with a small tube placed in the cervix is usually diagnostic. however, many physicians will, in order to save time, use a small balloon catheter placed in the uterus. the latter technique will overlook a number of cases of this syndrome. the gold standard for diagnosis uses a hysteroscope that pictures the interior of the uterus directly.

Eosinophilic-Gastroenteritis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:eosinophilic gastroenteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. symptoms include dysphagia (sometimes presenting as food impaction), heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating (ascites is possible). the eosinophilic infiltration may involve one or more layers of the gastrointestinal wall. the particular symptoms present in each person depend upon the layer and the location of involvement. most commonly, the stomach wall and the small bowel are involved. mucosal involvement leads to protein-losing enteropathy and malabsorption. muscle layer involvement causes abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspeptic symptoms and bowel obstruction. subserosal involvement predominantly causes ascites with marked eosinophilia. sometimes eosinophilic pleural effusion is present. eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a chronic, waxing and waning condition. the exact cause of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is unknown. some cases of this disease may be caused by a hypersensitivity to certain foods or other unknown allergens. often, a family history of allergy is present. atopy (asthma, hay fever or eczema) is present in a subset of patients. food allergies are common. eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease (10/100.000) that affects both males and females, but is slightly more common among men. peak prevalence is in children and adults 20-50 years of age. the reported prevalence has increased markedly, and this is probably due to prior under-diagnosis. people with a history of allergies, eczema, and seasonal asthma are more likely to develop this disease. some patients present with elevated ige and eosinophilia of tissue and blood. a careful history may suggest to the physician that a biopsy is required. the results of the biopsy (endoscopic or full-thickness surgical biopsy) are usually diagnostic.

Long-QT-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:long qt syndrome (lqts) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by abnormalities of the heart's electrical conduction system, and is characterized on the electrocardiogram (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) by prolongation of the qt interval that corresponds to prolongation of the recovery phase or repolarization of the heart muscle (ventricular myocardium) after each heartbeat. qt prolongation predisposes those affected to an increased risk of life threatening sudden alterations in the cardiac rhythm, (termed arrhythmias), specifically torsade de pointes (tdp) or ventricular fibrillation (vf). these arrhythmias can lead to sudden loss of consciousness (syncope), cardiac arrest and potentially cause sudden cardiac death. the severity of cardiac symptoms varies greatly from one person to another, even among family members who carry the same rare genetic variant. some individuals may have no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) for their entire lives, whilst others develop arrhythmias resulting in episodes of syncope, and cardiac arrest, at a young age. several different factors are known to trigger the onset of symptoms including physical activity, excitement and fright, although cardiac events may occur while asleep or at rest. long qt syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers and has been identified in all ethnic groups. the exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is not known. it is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 2,000 live births from a clinical and genetic study of 44,500 newborns (neonates).

document:blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (brbns) is a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder that affects the skin and internal organs of the body. multiple distinctive skin lesions are usually characteristic of this disorder and are often present at birth or present during early childhood. lesions in the gastrointestinal tract frequently become apparent during childhood or early adulthood. the lesions are multifocal venous malformations, resulting from abnormal embryonic blood vessel development. brbns is characterized by soft, elevated lesions on the skin or just under the skin that are dark blue, red, purple-red or black in color. the venous malformations may be tender, contain blood and be easily compressed and are usually located on the upper limbs, trunk and soles of the feet but can occur anywhere. the lesions increase in size and become more apparent over time but have not been reported to become cancerous. the organ system most commonly affected by brbns is the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, particularly the small intestine. the lesions in the gi tract often bleed and can lead to mild or severe anemia. iron replacement and/or frequent blood transfusions may be required. the gi lesions can also cause an obstruction or blockage (intussusception) of part of the bowel. skeletal abnormalities and venous malformations in muscle are sometimes associated with brbns. blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is sporadic.  although families have been described in which the condition follows autosomal dominant inheritance, these families actually have other multifocal venous malformations. blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature. brbns is diagnosed by physical examination and a procedure in which the gi tract is illuminated and visualized (endoscopy). genetic testing for brbns is available on a research basis only.

Polycystic-Liver-Disease,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:polycystic liver disease is characterized by the growth of more than 10 cysts in the liver, ranging in size from a few millimeters to over 15 cm in diameter. symptoms usually begin to show in people around 50 years old, as cysts grow in size and number with age [1]. some people begin to have symptoms in early adulthood and many affected individuals do not have symptoms. the growth and accumulation of cysts can cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and compression of adjacent anatomical structures, leading to abdominal pain and discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), indigestion (dyspepsia), gastro-esophageal reflux, and limited mobility [3-6]. more rarely, liver cysts can also compress the bile duct and lead to yellowing of the skin (jaundice). compression of the blood vessels of the liver by cysts can lead to accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), bleeding, and high blood pressure in the blood flow from intestines to the liver (portal hypertension) [12-14].  in rare cases, patients can suffer from cyst bleeding (hepatic cyst hemorrhage), or a cyst can be infected by bacteria (hepatic cyst infection), causing pain and fever. infrequently, large liver cysts may rupture, causing severe abdominal pain. (van aerts et al. 2017) even with the presence of many cysts, the liver of individuals with polycystic liver disease functions normally. polycystic liver disease affects around one in 100,000 people [1, 2]. males and females are affected in equal numbers, but most patients with symptoms and with severe disease are women. the suggested cause of this difference is that female sex hormones, such as estrogen, contribute to growth of liver cysts  [1, 3, 7, 13, 17, 22]. oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy are also associated with more severe disease [23-25]. cysts can begin to grow at any age, but are rare in childhood and more common with age. the age at which symptoms begin to occur varies with individuals, but is usually around 50 years old.

document:osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis (avn), aseptic necrosis or ischemic bone necrosis, is a disease resulting in the death of bone cells. if the process involves the bones near a joint, it often leads to collapse of the joint surface and subsequent arthritis due to an irregular joint surface. the exact cause is unknown. in the early stages of osteonecrosis, patients may not have any symptoms. as the disease progresses, however, most patients experience joint pain - at first, only when putting weight on the affected joint, and then even when resting. pain usually develops gradually and may be mild or severe. if osteonecrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse, pain may develop or increase dramatically. pain may be severe enough to cause joint stiffness by limiting the range of motion in the affected joint. disabling osteoarthritis may develop in the affected joint. the period of time between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each patient, ranging from several months to more than a year. osteonecrosis usually affects people between 30 and 50 years of age; about 10,000 to 20,000 people develop osteonecrosis each year in the united states. osteonecrosis affects both men and women and affects people of all ages. it is most common among people in their thirties and forties. depending on a person's risk factors and whether the underlying cause is trauma, it also can affect younger or older people.

document:erythrokeratodermia variabilis is an inherited skin disorder characterized by two features: short-lasting red patches in various sizes and shapes that may involve any part of the body; and thickening of the skin (hyperkeratosis). the hyperkeratosis can either be generalized, or localized as fixed, sharply defined, thickened plaques. the hyperkeratosis may also involve the skin of the palms and soles. skin lesions are made worse by sudden changes in temperature and friction. the red patches may be accompanied by a burning sensation. erythrokeratodermia variabilis is a rare inherited disorder of the cornification of the skin, which often presents at birth.  males and females are affected in equal numbers.  there seems to be no predilection by race or ethnicity. therapy is symptomatic and focuses on diminishing the build-up of skin (hyperkeratosis). systemic therapy with oral retinoids is very effective, but has to be carefully monitored because of side effects. moreover, the treatment is only effective as long as one takes the medication. after stopping treatment, the skin changes reappear within a short period of time. topical skin care may include emollients and keratolytics such as; urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, propylene glycol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids preparations. avoiding mechanical irritation of the skin can be beneficial.

Dubin-Johnson-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:dubin johnson syndrome is a rare genetic liver disorder that tends to affect people of middle eastern jewish heritage disproportionately to other groups. it appears to be associated with clotting factor vii in this population. symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender. jaundice, which is caused by excess bilirubin (bile pigment), is usually the only symptom of dubin johnson syndrome.  otherwise a physical examination is normal.  the disorder rarely appears before puberty.  occasionally the patient may have an enlarged and tender liver and complain of weakness and a painful abdomen, but the liver will function normally. there may sometimes be a mild recurrence of the jaundice. pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives may cause the disease to become apparent in women when no symptoms appeared previously. dubin johnson syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  in recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  if an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  the risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  the risk is the same for each pregnancy. dubin johnson syndrome is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  the disorder can occur in all races.  however, among iranian, iraqi and moroccan jews the incidence is as high as 1 in 1300.  in japan an unusually high incidence of dubin-johnson syndrome was found in an isolated area where there was a high rate of intermarriage.  age at onset can be anytime between 10 weeks of age to 56 years. treatment of dubin johnson syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. in many cases patients may require no treatment even though they have recurrent mild jaundice. however, metabolism of certain drugs may be affected in patients with dubin-johnson syndrome since many pharmaceutical products are metabolized in the liver. therefore, medications should be carefully supervised by a physician. genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families affected by dubin johnson syndrome.

document:hypochrondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by small stature and disproportionately short arms, legs, hands, and feet (short-limbed dwarfism). short stature often is not recognized until early to mid childhood or, in some cases, as late as adulthood. in those with the disorder, bowing of the legs typically develops during early childhood but often improves spontaneously with age. some affected individuals may also have an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), a relatively prominent forehead, and/or other physical abnormalities associated with the disorder. in addition, in about 10 percent of cases, mild mental retardation may be present. hypochondroplasia appears to affect females and males in relatively equal numbers.  the features of the disorder were originally reported in 1913; hypochondroplasia was described as a distinct disease entity in 1924.  over 100 cases have since been recorded in the medical literature, including isolated (sporadic) and familial cases.  hypochondroplasia is thought to have an incidence of approximately one-twelfth that of achondroplasia.  (incidence refers to the number of new cases of a particular disorder or condition during a specific period.)  the estimated frequency of achondroplasia has ranged from about one in 15,000 to one in 35,000 births.  (for further information on achondroplasia, please see the ""related disorders"" section of this report below.) as noted previously, in individuals with hypochondroplasia, short stature often may not be recognized until early or mid childhood or as late as adulthood. the disorder may be diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination; identification of characteristic physical findings (e.g., short stature, brachydactyly, genu varum, macrocephaly); x-ray studies; and/or other diagnostic techniques.

Congenital-Erythropoietic-Porphyria,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:congenital erythropoietic porphyria (cep) is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder resulting from the deficient function of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen lll cosynthase (uros), the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. due to the impaired function of this enzyme, excessive amounts of particular porphyrins accumulate, particularly in the bone marrow, plasma, red blood cells, urine, teeth, and bones. the major symptom of this disorder is hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight and some types of artificial light, such as fluorescent lights (photosensitivity). after exposure to light, the photo-activated porphyrins in the skin cause bullae (blistering) and the fluid-filled sacs rupture, and the lesions often get infected. these infected lesions can lead to scarring, bone loss, and deformities. the hands, arms, and face are the most commonly affected areas. cep is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. typically, there is no family history of the disease. neither parent has symptoms of cep, but each carries a defective gene that they can pass to their children. affected offspring have two copies of the defective gene, one inherited from each parent. cep is a very rare genetic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. over 200 cases have been reported worldwide.

Rubella,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:rubella is a viral infection characterized by fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, aching joints, and a distinctive red rash. although it is sometimes called german measles or three-day measles, it is not caused by the same virus that causes measles. rubella is generally mild in children and more severe but not life-threatening in adults. however, if a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, it can cause serious problems for the unborn child. in the united states, most children receive the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine, and therefore the disease has become uncommon. in march 2005, health officials announced that rubella has been eliminated from the united states. however, it is still important for americans to vaccinate their children, and women who are pregnant or might get pregnant still need to be sure they are immune, because the disease exists elsewhere. according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), nine rubella cases were reported in the united states in 2004, and all of them originated in other countries. rubella affects males and females in equal numbers.  during 1964 and 1965, according to the cdc, a rubella epidemic in the united states caused an estimated 12.5 million cases of rubella and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome, which led to more than 11,600 babies born deaf, 11,250 fetal deaths, 2,100 neonatal deaths, 3,580 babies born blind, and 1,800 babies born mentally retarded.  since 1969, the rubella virus has been included in the measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccine routinely given to babies and young children. since the rubella rash is so much like rashes caused by other viruses, the definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of blood tests for the presence of the virus.

Carcinoid-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:the underlying cause of carcinoid tumors remains unclear. some studies have suggested risk factors such as smoking and dietary intake, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. in the majority of cases tumors are slow-growing and can produce hormonal chemical substances such as serotonin, bradykinins, tachykinins and prostaglandins. if the original carcinoid cells spread (metastasize) to the liver, these substances are no longer broken down to their inactive form and are released into the systemic (main) circulation, causing the signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. when tumors affect organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the ovaries, carcinoid syndrome can occur in the absence of liver metastases. carcinoid tumors are rare, with only 27 new cases per million diagnosed in the u.s. per year. of these, only about 10% will develop carcinoid syndrome. the syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. all races can be affected though there is a slightly increased prevalence in black african males. all ages can be affected but most gastrointestinal cases occur in middle-age. bronchial (airway) tumors are most often seen in the fifth decade but can affect people at any age. carcinoid syndrome may be more prevalent than suspected because diagnosis is difficult and sometimes overlooked; some patients may not exhibit all three of the hallmark symptoms of flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea. diagnosis is best achieved with a multimodality approach including biochemical investigation, radiological and nuclear imaging, and finally histological (tissue biopsy) confirmation where possible. the occurrence of episodic facial flushing and/or chronic diarrhea not diagnosed by standard tests as being a result of more common causes should lead to suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. in the past, measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyendolacetic acid (5-hiaa), a product of the breakdown (metabolism) of serotonin, in a patient on a low serotonin diet was the main lab test used. it is still useful and the level of 5-hiaa will be clearly elevated in 50% of the cases. however, there are also blood tests available, the most useful being chromogranin-a, often in combination with an imaging technique known as octreoscan, that may confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome even when urinary 5-hiaa is normal. this technique may also be helpful in indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors when the full spectrum of symptoms is not apparent. other investigations that may be helpful, depending on the location of the primary tumor, include ct scan, ultrasound, mri and endoscopy. sometimes the diagnosis is established incidentally at the time of surgery for another suspected condition such as intestinal obstruction or appendicitis.

Fibromuscular-Dysplasia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:fibromuscular dysplasia, commonly called fmd, is a disease that causes one or more arteries in the body to have abnormal cell development in the artery wall. as a result, areas of narrowing (stenosis), aneurysms, or tears (dissection) may occur. if narrowing or a tear causes a decrease in blood flow through the artery, symptoms may result. fmd is most commonly found in the arteries that supply the kidneys with blood (renal arteries) and the arteries called the carotid and vertebral arteries which are found in the neck and supply the brain with blood. less commonly, fmd affects the arteries in the abdomen (supplying the liver, spleen and intestines) and extremities (legs and arms). in more than one-half of people with this disease, there will be evidence of fmd in more than one artery. fmd affects women far more commonly than men, although men and children can be affected with this disease. in children with fmd, the disease seems to more commonly present with significant narrowing rather than tears of arteries and also seems to involve the arteries to the kidneys and intestines more commonly than the carotid vessels. in the pediatric population, fmd affects both boys and girls. the vascular subtype of ehlers-danlos syndrome (type iv) has been associated with the most common type of fibromuscular dysplasia, known as multifocal fmd. this syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries in addition to the typical angiographic findings of fibromuscular dysplasia. there have been isolated reports of fibromuscular dysplasia associated with other disorders, including alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, marfan syndrome, and moyamoya disease. (for more information on these disorders, search for the term in the rare disease database.) in order to diagnosis fmd, a test must be done to image the blood vessels. there are many options for imaging the arteries, including specialized blood vessel ultrasound known as duplex ultrasound; a cat scan of the arteries which is obtained after a dye is given through the veins, or a special type of mri. in many cases, the diagnosis of fmd requires that a procedure known as an arteriogram be performed. arteriography is a procedure that is performed by a radiologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular medicine specialist with appropriate training. it involves inserting a wire into or near the affected artery and injecting contrast material, a dye that can be detected by an x-ray machine. an x-ray of the affected area is then taken and examined. the individual is usually awake during an arteriogram procedure although medications may be given to keep her or him comfortable. this outpatient procedure usually lasts from one to two hours with a recovery period of up to six hours (this varies widely).

document:primary myelofibrosis is a chronic blood disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. it can occur at any age although it usually affects individuals more than 50 years of age. the median age at diagnosis is approximately 65. the incidence is estimated to be 1.5 cases per 100,000 people in the united states. in studies of northern european countries, the incidence was estimated to be .5 cases per 100,000 people. the worldwide incidence is unknown. when primary myelofibrosis affects children, it is usually before three years of age. in younger children, girls are affected twice as often as boys. diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and various specialized tests. in many people, the presenting sign of the disorder is an abnormally enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) that may be detected upon routine examination or low levels of circulating red blood cells. a complete blood count (cbc) may demonstrate low levels of red blood cells or elevated levels of platelets or white blood cells. since blood cell counts vary at different times in affected individuals, blood counts are not definitive in diagnosing primary myelofibrosis. surgical removal and microscopic examination of bone marrow tissue (biopsy) is often used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis.

document:the exact cause of megalocornea intellectual disability syndrome is unknown. megalocornea, when occurring as an isolated finding, is usually inherited as an x-linked recessive trait. recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits the same abnormal gene for the same trait from each parent. if an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms. the risk for two carrier parents to both pass the defective gene and, therefore, have an affected child is 25 percent with each pregnancy. the risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50 percent with each pregnancy. the chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents and be genetically normal for that particular trait is 25 percent. the risk is the same for males and females. approximately 37 individuals with megalocornea intellectual disability syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. more males have been reported than females. the disorder is present at birth (congenital). the syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1975.

Balantidiasis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:balantidiasis is a rare intestinal infection caused by the bacterium, balantidium coli, a single celled parasite (ciliate protozoan) that frequently infects pigs but on occasion (rarely) infects humans. some infected people may have no symptoms or only mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort but others may experience more severe symptoms reminiscent of an acute inflammation of the intestines. symptoms of balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. most people with balantidiasis are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms.  some individuals may become acutely ill with abnormally high temperatures, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.  such conditions may result in the excessive loss of water from the body (dehydration) and extreme exhaustion (prostration), especially if b. coli attacks the intestinal lining causing inflammation and possibly ""crater-like"" areas of damage (ulceration).  in very severe cases, the ulcers may be deep enough to puncture the intestinal wall (perforation) resulting in acute inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdomen (peritonitis). occasionally, the ulcer may diminish lung function. balantidiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by the single celled (protozoan) parasite balantidium coli.  this parasite may be passed directly to humans by contact with pig feces or indirectly by drinking contaminated water.  poor nutrition, a compromised immune system, or other illnesses may make a person vulnerable to more severe symptoms of this disease. balantidiasis is a rare infection that affects males and females in equal numbers.  it typically occurs in tropical regions such as brazil, new guinea, and southern iran.

(for more information on stuve-wiedemann syndrome see the related disorders section of this report.) sjs (sjs) types 1 and 2 are rare disorders that appear to affect males and females in equal numbers. more than 85 cases have been reported in the medical literature, including individuals affected by the classical (type 1) and the more severe neonatal form (type 2) of the disorder. sjs type 2 appears to be most common in individuals of united arab emirates descent. depending upon the form of the disorder present, associated symptoms and findings may be recognized at birth or may become apparent during infancy or within the second year of life.

Nelson-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:nelson syndrome is a disorder characterized by abnormal hormone secretion, enlargement of the pituitary gland (hypophysis), and the development of large and invasive growths known as adenomas. it occurs in an estimated 15 to 25 percent of people who undergo surgical removal of the adrenal glands for cushing disease. symptoms associated with nelson syndrome include intense skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation), headaches, vision impairment, and the cessation of menstrual periods in women. symptoms of nelson syndrome include intense skin pigmentation, headaches, visual field disturbances and the cessation of menstrual periods in females. blood levels of the pituitary hormones adrenocorticotrope hormone (acth) and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (beta-msh) are abnormally high.  the pituitary gland gets abnormally large in nelson syndrome, causing headaches and visceral symptoms. nelson syndrome can be caused by surgical removal of the adrenal glands on both sides of the body (bilateral adrenalectomy).  removal of the adrenal glands is a treatment for cushing disease.  cushing disease is the name given to a condition in which cushing syndrome, an endocrine disorder, occurs because of the presence of benign (non-cancerous) tumors on the pituitary gland.  following removal of these adrenal glands, some people will develop nelson syndrome.  growth of a pre-existing or a concealed (occult) tumor of the pituitary gland may also cause this disorder. nelson syndrome affects approximately 15 to 25% of people who have undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.  it affects males and females in equal numbers.  cases caused by tumors are very rare. when nelson syndrome is suspected, blood samples are analyzed for the presence or absence of cortisol and/or aldosterone. imaging studies such as cat scans or magnetic resonance imaging may also be used.

Perniosis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:perniosis is an inflammatory disorder that is triggered by prolonged exposure to cold and damp (humid) conditions. it is a form of inflammation of the small blood vessels (vasculitis) and is characterized by painful, itchy, tender, skin lesions on the lower legs, hands, toes, feet, ears and face. the lesions usually last for two to three weeks. one form of the disorder affects the blood vessels of the thighs. the exact cause of perniosis is unclear.  cold weather causes the small veins and arteries close to the skin to tighten or constrict.  when the tissues are rewarmed, blood leaks into the tissue and causes the skin to swell.  the swelling irritates the nerves, and pain is the result.  it is thought by some that the disorder may represent an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the cold.  prolonged exposure to the cold, insufficient protective clothing, and circulatory or cardiovascular diseases may also be causative factors.  some cases are believed to be caused by genetic factors.  other suspected causes include nutrition, local infection, hormonal changes, and other systemic diseases. perniosis is seen more often in females than in males.  also, it is seen more often in women who are very thin.  several articles in the medical literature focus on cases of perniosis in anorexic women.  individuals with poor circulation and smokers are affected more frequently than the general population.  the disorder is more common in damp climates than in dry ones.  symptoms usually begin before the age of 20 years. diagnosis is the result of physical examination and the close examination of the process of rewarming.

document:autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type ii, also known as schmidt syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disorder in which there is a steep drop in production of several essential hormones by the glands that secrete these hormones. when first described, this disorder was thought to involve only adrenal insufficiency (addison's disease) and thyroid insufficiency (hashimoto's thyroiditis). however, over time, as more patients were studied, the scope of the disorder was expanded to include disorders of other underperforming endocrine glands. these include the gonads, which secrete sex hormones; the pancreas which secretes insulin and is intimately tied up with diabetes mellitus; and sometimes the parathyroid glands. failure of the endocrine glands to function is usually accompanied by signs of malnutrition because the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb nutrients is reduced dramatically.  since the combination of affected glands differs from patient to patient, the signs of this disorder are diverse. the exact cause of aips-ii is not known, but it is thought to result from one or more abnormal immune responses.  autoimmune reactions occur when, for reasons not quite clear, the body mistakenly reacts to a normal antibody as if it were a foreign one. report suggest that the prevalence of aips-ii is about 14 to 20 cases per million of population and that it affects females 3 to 4 times as often as it does males.  aips-ii usually strikes in the third or fourth decade of life. each disorder in a case of autoimmune polyendocrine type ii is treated separately. for many of the specific disorders, treatment is focused on hormone replacement therapy.

document:giant cell arteritis (gca) is the most common blood vessel disorder in persons over 50 years old that causes inflammation of medium and large-sized arteries in the body (vasculitis). gca causes changes in blood vessel walls leading to poor blood circulation. arteries most affected in giant cell arteritis are the temporal artery and other cranial arteries (now called cranial-gca), but inflammation of the aorta and other large arteries in the body can occur as well and may present differently (now called large vessel-gca). if left untreated, this can lead to a medical emergency where sudden blindness occurs without early detection and treatment. signs and symptoms when the temporal or other cranial arteries are involved include arm pain, pulsing headaches on one side or on the back of the head, jaw pain, scalp tenderness, double vision or other visual disturbances, bulging temporal artery that is tender with skin edema and redness. it can also present with constitutional symptoms such as polymyalgia, fevers, anorexia, and weight loss, a presentation of lv-gca. the cause of giant cell arteritis is still unknown but is thought to be from the immune system causing damage to the body's own blood vessels. polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that is closely related to giant cell arteritis and occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with giant call arteritis. 15% to 20% of persons with polymyalgia rheumatica will have giant cell arteritis. treatments available include steroids (corticosteroids) that will help with symptoms and reoccurrence and medications that weaken the immune system. giant cell arteritis most commonly affects those over 50 years old (mostly above 65 years) and is more common in caucasians, people of nordic or northern european descent, and others in northern latitudes. women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop gca than men in persons of northern european descent while there is no higher risk for women from spain, israel, turkey, other mediterranean countries, and india. specifically, about 20 per 100,000 people among whites in northern european populations are affected, 10 per 100,000 people affected among southern european populations, and about 1 per 100,000 people affected among american populations of asian or african descent.

document:fascioliasis is a rare infectious disorder caused by parasites. these parasites are liver flukes that live in plant-eating animals. liver flukes can be found on water plants in certain parts of the world. when the parasite invades the liver, bile passages may be blocked. a subdivision of fascioliasis called halzoun syndrome affects the throat (pharynx). this infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment. the disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  the acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  the latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  the chronic phase can persist for several years.  symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness. fascioliasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worms of the genus fasciola, of which ""fasciola hepatica"", found in temperate climates, and ""fasciola gigantica"", found in tropical climates, are the most common.  encysted parasitic larvae of these parasites live on water plants, such as watercress, that may be eaten by man or eaten by animals that subsequently are eaten by man.  once ingested, the larvae escape from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate across the intestinal wall into the abdominal cavity.  they transform into immature worms and, once they reach the liver, move around for up to six weeks, feeding on liver tissue.  eventually, they take up residence in the bile ducts, where they cause lesions and chronic liver disease.  generally, the parasite can be killed by adequate cooking of foods before they are eaten. liver fluke disease should be suspected if the patient recently spent time in a region where infection is prevalent in animals and/or humans. patients usually report eating wild watercress, algae, or other aquatic plants. acute and chronic infection can be confirmed by testing that detects liver fluke-specific antibodies in body fluids. also, parasite eggs may be detected in the stool at the chronic stage of infection.

document:dupuytren's contracture is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by fixation of the joints (e.g., proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) of certain fingers in a permanently flexed position (joint contractures). due to abnormal thickening and shortening of the bands of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the palm (palmar fascia), a hardened nodule may develop, eventually forming an abnormal band of hardened (fibrotic) tissue. as a result, the fingers of the affected area begin to be drawn in toward the palm over several months or years and cannot be pulled back (contracture). in addition, the skin of the affected area may pucker. in most cases, the ring and pinky (fourth and fifth) fingers are most affected. in addition, the disorder usually affects both hands (bilateral). although the exact cause of dupuytren's contracture is unknown, risk for the disorder appears to be increased by alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis) and the presence or certain other diseases, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. in addition, it is thought that genetic predisposition may be a factor. dupuytren's contracture is characterized by a drawing up of the fingers toward the palms of the hand.  the feet are rarely involved.  loss of function of the fingers and deformities may also occur, including nodular growths on the fingers.  one or both hands may be affected.  the right hand seems to be more frequently involved when involvement is only one sided (unilateral).  the ring finger is involved most often, followed in order by the little, middle and index fingers.  a nodule or plaque may develop as the first symptom on the finger.  symptoms may develop spontaneously and without any known associated condition.  in other cases liver disease, alcoholism, pulmonary tuberculosis or diabetes mellitus may occur in conjunction with dupuytren's contracture. dupuytren's contracture is a disease of the fibrous tissue.  its cause is unknown, but genetic predisposition and the presence of other diseases or medical conditions may be factors.  it appears that one's risk is increased by certain lifestyle factors, such as alcoholism, and the presence of certain diseases, such as liver disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. the diagnosis of dupuytren's contracture may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation including a comprehensive patient history, observation of characteristic findings, and specialized tests. histochemical tests and use of an electron microscope may confirm the diagnosis of dupuytren's contracture.

Carnitine-Palmitoyltransferase-1A-Deficiency,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a deficiency (cpt1a) is characterized by a sudden onset of liver failure and damage to the nervous system resulting from liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy), usually associated with fasting or illness. cpt1a deficiency is caused by an abnormality (mutation) in the cpt1a gene that results in the production of an abnormally functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 enzyme and decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. cpt1a deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. three types of cpt1a deficiency have been recognized:  the hepatic encephalopathy type usually occurs in children and is associated with a low level of ketones in the blood, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), enlarged liver, muscle weakness and elevated carnitine in the blood.  the adult-onset myopathy type is characterized by a sudden onset of muscle cramping associated with exercise without low blood sugar or liver dysfunction.  the third type is acute fatty liver of pregnancy that occurs when a pregnant woman with one abnormal cpt1a gene carries a fetus with two abnormal cpt1a genes and is associated with liver failure in the mother. cpt1a deficiency has been reported in approximately 30-40 individuals.   the incidence of this condition may be higher in the hutterite populations in the northern united states and canada and the inuit populations in northern canada, alaska and greenland.  this condition occurs with equal frequency in males and females. cpt1a deficiency is diagnosed by a combination of physical symptoms and laboratory testing. the typical laboratory findings include low levels of ketones, elevated liver transaminases, elevated ammonia and elevated total serum carnitine.  cpt1a enzyme activity on the cultured skin cells from affected individuals is 1-5% of normal. molecular genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis if the enzyme test is abnormal.  some state newborn screening programs perform screening for cpt1a deficiency by measuring the ratio of free to total carnitine in blood plasma or serum. carrier testing for relatives is available using cpt1a enzyme testing or molecular genetic testing.

document:""the term """"aids dysmorphic syndrome"""" or """"hiv embryopathy"""" has been used by some researchers to describe specific facial malformations (i.e., craniofacial dysmorphism), an unusually small head, and growth deficiency in some infants infected with hiv.* such craniofacial abnormalities have included a prominent, boxlike forehead, large, wide eyes; a flattened nasal bridge, and an unusually pronounced philtrum, which is the vertical groove in the center of the upper lip. most new cases of hiv infection in young children (pediatric hiv infection) are caused by transmission from the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding (perinatal transmission).  estimates suggest that the transmission rate from untreated hiv-positive mothers in the united states is approximately 12 to 30 percent. (for further information, please see the ""standard therapies"" section of this report below.)  women with hiv infection are most often infected through heterosexual relations with an infected partner or injection drug use. perinatal hiv infection is thought to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  as noted above, in some cases, certain dysmorphic features have been observed prior to the onset of symptoms associated with immunodeficiency.  however, the significance of such observations has been questioned (see ""symptoms"").  symptoms and findings resulting from immunodeficiency may become apparent during the first or second year of life or later during childhood. perinatal hiv infection is considered in infants of mothers known to be hiv-positive and/or in infants and children who have certain characteristic symptoms of hiv infection or immune system abnormalities. infants who are born to mothers with hiv have antibodies against the virus in the bloodstream at birth (passively acquired maternal antibodies). in infants and children who are not infected with hiv, these passive antibodies eventually disappear, usually between six to 12 months, however, in some cases, they may be detectable for up to 18 months. therefore, testing that detects the presence of hiv antibodies in the blood (serum antibody tests, e.g., enzyme immunoassay and confirmatory western blot) in a child 18 months or older usually indicates infection; however, such testing is not conclusive in children younger than 18 months. in these children, hiv infection may be confirmed through the repeated use of various specialized viral detection laboratory tests (e.g., hiv viral cultures, a dna-amplification and copying method known as polymerase chain reaction [pcr]). additional laboratory tests may also be conducted to assess immune functioning in order to assist in diagnosis and to monitor disease progression and its treatment. testing may include monitoring of helper t cell numbers (cd4+ cells), the ratio of helper t cells to certain other white blood cells (cd8+ cells), complete blood counts, and blood platelet levels.""

Retinopathy-of-Prematurity,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:retinopathy of prematurity (rop) is a potentially blinding disease affecting the retinas in premature infants. the retinas are the light-sensitive linings of the insides of the eyes. in infants born prematurely, the blood vessels that supply the retinas are not yet completely developed. although blood vessel growth continues after birth, these vessels may develop in an abnormal, disorganized pattern, known as rop. in some affected infants, the changes associated with rop spontaneously subside. however, in others, rop may lead to bleeding, scarring of the retina, retinal detachment and visual loss. even in cases in which rop changes cease or regress spontaneously, affected children may have an increased risk of certain eye (ocular) abnormalities, including nearsightedness, misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), and/or future retinal detachment. the two major risk factors for rop are a low birth weight and premature delivery. rop is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in infants in many industrialized and ""middle-income"" countries. as noted above, an increased incidence of rop in the 1940s and 1950s was shown to be due to the use of high concentrations of supplemental oxygen in premature infants. the number of cases decreased with measures to monitor oxygen blood levels carefully. however, with modern advances in care and technology in neonatal intensive care units (nicus), the incidence of rop has increased as more premature infants of lower birth weights survive. careful control of blood oxygen levels reduces the risk of rop without compromising measures necessary to sustain life. again, supplementary oxygen alone does not appear to be sufficient for the development of rop. (for more, see ""causes"" above.)

document:amniotic fluid embolism (afe) is an extremely rare, but life-threatening complication that affects pregnant women shortly before, during, or immediately following labor and childbirth. most instances occur during labor. in this disorder, it is hypothesized that a pregnant woman has a severe, allergic reaction to amniotic fluid or other fetal material such as fetal cells, which enter the mother's bloodstream. amniotic fluid is contained within the amniotic sac. this fluid supports, cushions, and protects a developing fetus. amniotic fluid embolism is unpredictable and no risk factors have been identified.  afe can cause a severe, rapid decline in the mother's health. for years, some researchers believed that the amniotic fluid and fetal cells cause obstruction within the mother's blood vessels, but now most researchers believe that the mother's immune system reacts to the amniotic fluid and fetal cells causing an overwhelming immune system response, which ends up harming the mother and the fetus. breathing problems, cardiac arrest, and excessive bleeding are some of the life-threatening complications that can occur. researchers and physicians do not fully understand why amniotic fluid or fetal cells entering the mother's bloodstream causes this reaction in some women. amniotic fluid embolism is a medical emergency that develops suddenly and rapidly and can be fatal. early recognition and prompt supportive treatment are essential. amniotic fluid embolism is a rare complication that occurs just before, during, or immediately after birth. the number of women who have experienced this complication is unknown.  amniotic fluid embolism is a rare disorder. rare disorders often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. estimates have ranged from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 80,000 pregnancies.

Congenital-Sucrase,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (csid) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficiency or absence of the enzymes sucrase and isomaltase. this enzyme complex (sucrase-isomaltase) assists in the breakdown of a certain sugars (i.e., sucrose) and certain products of starch digestion (dextrins). the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex is normally found within the tiny, finger-like projections (microvilli or brush border) lining the small intestine. when this enzyme complex is deficient, nutrients based on ingested sucrose and starch cannot be absorbed properly from the gut. symptoms of this disorder become evident soon after sucrose or starches, as found in modified milk formulas with sucrose or polycose, are ingested by an affected infant. breast-fed infants or those on lactose-only formula manifest no symptoms until such time as sucrose (found in fruit juices, solid foods, and/or some medications) is introduced into the diet. symptoms are variable among affected individuals but usually include watery diarrhea, abdominal swelling (distension) and/or discomfort, among others. intolerance to starch often disappears within the first few years of life and the symptoms of sucrose intolerance usually improve as the affected child ages. csid is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. csid is a metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is diagnosed in approximately 0.2 percent of north americans. this disorder has a higher frequency among greenland and canadian inuit populations, with a reported incidence of approximately 10 percent. in addition, researchers report a higher degree of homozygosity among these more frequently affected groups than among other groups. also, as a diagnosis may be easily missed, especially in those individuals with mild symptoms, many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of this disorder than is actually reported in the medical literature.

Alveolitis-Extrinsic-Allergic,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a lung disorder resulting from repeated inhalation of organic dust, usually in a specific occupational setting. in the acute form, respiratory symptoms and fever begin several hours after exposure to the dust. the chronic form is characterized by gradual changes in the lung tissue associated with several years of exposure to the irritant. in general, symptoms of all forms of extrinsic allergic alveolitis include breathing difficulty, wheezing, and dry coughs that appear to shake the entire body.  chills, sweating, aching, discomfort and/or fatigue may accompany lung symptoms.  most cases of this disorder are characterized by mild, short episodes that may be misdiagnosed.  chronic cases may develop with repeated episodes or prolonged exposure to a specific organic dust. these may involve more severe symptoms including fever, crackling sounds during breathing (rales), breathing difficulty, bluish appearance of the skin (cyanosis), and possibly, expectoration of blood 3. extrinsic allergic alveolitis may affect males and females in equal numbers, but usually affects individuals in occupations in which animal or vegetable dusts are inhaled by people allergic to the substances contained in such dusts. treatment of extrinsic allergic alveolitis initially depends on identification of the cause of the allergic reaction. if possible, the patient should avoid exposure to the allergen. in an occupational setting, mild cases may be alleviated by improved ventilation or use of air filtering masks. in severe or prolonged cases, however, changing jobs may be the better option. if symptoms persist in spite of avoidance, corticosteroid drugs may be tried. in acute cases, steroids in combination with avoidance measures can often reduce the severity of symptoms. all symptoms can usually be resolved in acute cases if they are diagnosed and treated early before permanent changes in the lungs can develop. if permanent lung changes have occurred at the time of diagnosis, it is possible that the patient may not respond well to treatment.

document:subacute cerebellar degeneration (scd) is characterized by the deterioration of the area of the brain concerned with muscle coordination and balance (the cerebellum). less frequently, the area involved may include the area connecting the spinal cord to the brain (the medulla oblongata, the cerebral cortex, and the brain stem). there are two types of subacute cerebellar degeneration: paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, which sometimes precedes the diagnosis of cancer, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration, caused by a lack of the vitamin b-1 (thiamine). these two types share symptoms but not the same cause. in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, the average age of onset is 50, with males affected more often than females.  this form of cerebellar degeneration may precede cancer.  alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration affects alcoholics and people with thiamine deficiency.  it is not related to cancer and is more common than the paraneoplastic type. paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may improve after successful treatment of the underlying cancer. for alcoholic/nutritional cerebellar degeneration, thiamine is given along with other b vitamins, usually relieving the condition if the patient stops drinking alcohol and resumes a normal diet.

document:47, xxy (ks) is not inherited. males with 47, xxy (ks) have one extra x chromosome because of a nondisjunction error that randomly occurs during the division of the sex chromosomes in the egg or sperm. some males with 47, xxy (ks) are mosaic, meaning that some cells have an extra x chromosome and other cells do not. mosaic 47, xxy (ks) occurs because of an error in the division of the sex chromosomes in the zygote after fertilization. the extra x chromosome typically results in primary testicular failure leading to androgen deficiency. 47, xxy (ks) is the most common human sex chromosome disorder and occurs in approximately 1 in 500-1,000 males. it is estimated that 3,000 affected boys are born each year in the united states. kallmann syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that mostly, but not exclusively, affects men. the major characteristics of kallmann syndrome, in both men and women, are the failure to experience puberty and the complete or partial loss of the sense of smell. failure to go through puberty reflects a hormonal imbalance that is caused by a failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. patients with kallmann syndrome show evidence of small genitalia, sterile gonads that cannot produce the sex cells (hypogonadism), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). the impaired production of hormones as well as sperm and egg cells causes delayed puberty, growth and infertility. (for more information on this disorder, choose ""kallmann syndrome"" as your search term in the rare disease database.) males with 47, xxy (ks) are most commonly identified before birth (e.g. through prenatal screenings for chromosomal disorders), at puberty, or later in life because of infertility. 47, xxy (ks) is diagnosed by a chromosome karyotype analysis on a blood sample or by a chromosomal microarray (cma) test. cma consists of an oral cheek (buccal) swab and is an easy and painless way to detect abnormalities of chromosome numbers and provide a definitive diagnosis. 47, xxy (ks) can also be diagnosed prenatally on chorionic villous or amniotic fluid cells.

document:a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and specialized procedures to measure oxidant production by white blood cells. in healthy individuals, the white blood cells produce a chemical oxidant that destroys bacteria. one blood test for diagnosis of cgd uses a molecule called dihydrorhodamine 123 (dhr) to determine whether or not white blood cells are making these oxidants normally. oxidants cause the dhr to fluoresce, which is markedly reduced or absent in cgd white blood cells. this test can be performed on blood samples shipped to clinical laboratories certified to perform this test. another blood test for cgd is called the nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) slide test. in this test, nbt is mixed with the white blood cells, which are then activated to produce oxidants that react with nbt, turning it a deep blue color. if this reaction does not occur, then these important oxidants are not being produced by an individual's white blood cells. if cgd is diagnosed based on defects in blood cell oxidant production, genetic testing is typically recommended to determine the specific type of cgd.

Anemia-Hemolytic-Cold-Antibody,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:cold antibody hemolytic anemia (caha) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (rbcs) by the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (antibodies). normally, the red blood cells have a life span of approximately 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen. in individuals with caha, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. the severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production. although cold antibody hemolytic anemia is known to be an autoimmune disorder, neither its exact underlying cause nor the process by which the disorder becomes apparent is fully understood.  autoimmune disorders occur when the body's natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown reasons. cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects older people.  the incidence of caha in the general population is about 1 in 80,000.  there appears to be a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of caha, with a male to female ratio of 2 to 3.  those individuals with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this disorder. in order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from the other anemias, doctors examine the patient's blood to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells, since the number of young cells is increased in hemolytic anemia. the patient is also examined to check for spleen or liver enlargement. an antiglobulin test (coomb's reaction) may be performed as the initial screening exam to detect the presence of immunoglobulin or complement on the red-cell membrane and to determine the specific class of immunoglobulin or complement present. in the case of cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin m (igm).

document:familial hypophosphatemia is a term that describes a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by impaired kidney conservation of phosphate and in some cases, altered vitamin d metabolism. in contrast, other forms of hypophosphatemia may result from inadequate dietary supply of phosphate, or its poor absorption from the intestines. the chronic hypophosphatemia resulting from these impairments can lead to rickets, a childhood bone disease with characteristic bow deformities of the legs, growth plate abnormalities, and progressive softening of the bone, referred to as osteomalacia.  in children, growth rates may be impaired, frequently resulting in short stature. in adults, the growth plate is not present so that osteomalacia is the evident bone problem. familial hypophosphatemia is most often inherited in an x-linked dominant manner, however, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of familial hypophosphatemia occur.

document:lichen planus (lp) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory autoimmune skin and mucous membrane disease. lp most commonly presents as itchy, shiny, reddish-purple spots (lesions) on the skin (cutaneous lp) or as white-gray lesions in the mouth or on the lips (oral lp). less commonly, lp may also involve the genitals (penile or vulvar lp), scalp (lichen planopilaris), ears (otic lp), nails, eyes, and esophagus. similar to lichen found growing on trees and rocks in forests, the skin lesions are often flat-topped and can be somewhat scaly, hence the name ""lichen"" planus. in most affected individuals, the exact cause of lp is unclear. it is suspected that exposure to infections, drugs, allergens, or injury may sensitize the immune system and cause the immune system to attack skin cells. this initial eruption may persist for weeks to months, and recurrences can continue throughout the individual's lifetime. there have been reports of lp in family members, indicating that there may be a genetic predisposition, but the genetic factors of lp are still being researched and are uncertain. there is limited data on how many people are affected by lp, but most studies estimate that lp occurs in less than 1 percent of the world's population. cutaneous lp occurs at similar frequencies in men and women, but women are somewhat more likely to develop oral lp or lichen planopilaris. there does not appear to be a racial predisposition for the disease. the majority of lp develops between 30 and 60 years of age but can affect older and younger individuals as well. in rare cases, children may be affected.

Dracunculosis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:dracunculosis is an infection caused by a parasitic worm known as dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm. infected water fleas release the larvae of the worm into drinking water. ingestion of contaminated water causes the larvae to migrate from the intestines via the abdominal cavity to the tissue under the skin. the larvae mature and release a toxic substance that makes the overlying skin ulcerate. after treatment, symptoms disappear and the worms can be safely removed from the skin. dracunculosis is characterized by chronic skin ulcers.  tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae of the parasitic worm known as dracunculus medinensis, or guinea worm.  a female worm ready to release larvae produces stinging elevated spots (papules), causing redness and itching of the skin.  these symptoms may be an allergic reaction to the parasite.  the spots form blisters and later rupture, developing into painful ulcers.  multiple ulcers (usually on the legs) are common.  without treatment, the worms are absorbed or protrude from the skin over a period of several weeks. the cause of dracunculosis is the consumption of water contaminated by the larvae of the parasitic worm dracunculus medinensis, which live in an intermediate host in the water.  the larvae are released from the intermediate host while in the stomach, where they mate and grow.  this stage lasts for as long as a year.  the female apparently survives this process and may grow to three feet in length.  the symptoms and characteristic ulcers and infections occur when the female moves from the stomach or intestine to tissues under the skin. in 1986, there were approximately 3.2 million cases of dracunculosis worldwide.  however, due to the efforts of several national and international organizations in cooperation with local governments, the incidence of the disease has significantly decreased.  according to current estimates, there are now fewer than 100,000 cases of dracunculosis worldwide, with the remaining cases primarily occurring in sudan and certain countries in west africa, such as nigeria and niger. in individuals with dracunculosis, the condition is diagnosed based upon characteristic symptoms (e.g., fever, pain, and blistering and ulceration of the affected area) in association with the emergence of the adult worm through the individual's skin.

Precocious-Puberty,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:precocious puberty means an abnormally early onset of puberty. a sequence of events occurs during which a child develops into a young adult beginning at an unexpectedly early age. glands that secrete growth and sex hormones begin to function abnormally early in life resulting in this condition. often, the exact cause of precocious puberty is not known. normal puberty begins with hypothalamic production of kisspeptin, which stimulates the pulsatile release of gnrh from the hypothalamus. this results in an increase in the frequency and magnitude of gonadotropin release, especially lh. unfortunately, it is challenging to determine the initial clinical corollary to these biochemical events. it has been suggested that there is a continuum of sexual development in girls from uncomplicated premature thelarche to true precocious puberty; the former being more likely to develop in girls under 2 years of age. this spectrum exists both clinically and biochemically and emphasizes the need for the clinician to distinguish between these conditions in patients when making decisions about treatment. the criteria for diagnosis and treatment of cpp need to be reached through a synthesis of clinical findings as well as laboratory evidence for activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. the gold standard for determination of pubertal gonadotropin secretion is the gnrh stimulation test, though many clinicians start with a sensitive measurement of serum lh. skeletal age determination is frequently obtained early in the work-up, and can be helpful in distinguishing isolated signs of puberty, which do not typically cause advancement in bone age as compared to true pp, which will advance bone maturity. in boys, serum dheas, testosterone, 17-oh progesterone and b-hcg levels are useful for the diagnosis of gipp. in girls, serum dheas, estradiol and 17-oh progesterone levels are useful. diagnostic studies including head mri and pelvic ultrasound are frequently required in the work-up of children with pp.

Post-Polio-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:post-polio syndrome (pps) is a syndrome that affects some people who have had polio (poliomyelitis) and occurs many years (typically from 10 to 40 years) after recovery from the initial infection. it is characterized by the development of progressive weakness in muscles that were affected by the original polio infection. in addition, those affected may experience extreme fatigue and joint pain. skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, may occur as a result of this syndrome. there is variation in the severity of symptoms. in severe cases, symptoms may mimic those of the rare disorder known as lou gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). the degree of muscle atrophy during the post-polio period appears to reflect the severity of the impact of the initial polio infection. people who were significantly affected by polio are more likely to experience severe symptoms from post-polio syndrome. the cause of this syndrome is not known. although exact numbers are not available, it has been estimated that there are 300,000 polio survivors in the united states and that from one-fourth to one-half of them may ultimately develop some degree of post-polio syndrome. post-polio syndrome affects people who have had acute episodes of poliomyelitis.  it occurs 10 years or more after the original illness, and can occur as long as 40 years afterward.  according to one estimate, 25% to 50% of the 300,000 polio survivors in the united states may develop the syndrome.  at the present time, there is no known way to prevent the syndrome. diagnosis of post-polio syndrome is made on the basis of a thorough history, a neurological examination, and the process of excluding other possible diseases through various tests. in making the diagnosis, physicians will be aware of three factors. a prior diagnosis of polio, an interval of one or more decades since the original acute episode, and slow, steady, progressive deterioration.

Eosinophilic-Esophagitis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:eosinophilic esophagitis (eoe) is a chronic disorder of the digestive system in which large numbers of a particular type of white blood cell called eosinophils are present in the esophagus. the esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. eosinophils are an important part of the immune system and play a role in immune regulation and fighting certain infection, and their accumulation is a hallmark of allergic diseases. this condition is characterized by vomiting, stomach or chest pain, failure to thrive (particularly in children), difficulty swallowing, and food getting stuck in the throat. the symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis are variable, especially in people of different ages. common symptoms include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); food getting stuck in the throat (impaction); nausea; vomiting; poor growth; weight loss; stomach pain; poor appetite; and malnutrition. because of an overlap of these symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), many patients are initially thought to have gerd, but eoe patients do not typically respond to anti-gerd therapy and can be found not to have gerd upon diagnostic workup. recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (ppi) therapy, typically used for the treatment of gerd, but these patients with ppi responsive esophageal eosinophilia (ppi-ree) do not typically have gerd but rather a disease variant similar to eoe; the ppi appears to exert its effects by direct action rather than blockade of stomach acid alone. individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis often have allergic diseases such as asthma or eczema. the frequency of eosinophilic esophagitis has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 1,000 children. this condition has been reported in multiple continents including europe, australia, and america.

document:brown syndrome is a rare eye disorder characterized by defects in eye movements. this disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or may occur as the result of another underlying disorder (acquired). muscles control the movements of the eyes. some of these muscles turn the eyeball up and down, move the eyeball from side to side, or enable the eyeball to rotate slightly in its socket. the superior oblique tendon sheath of the superior oblique muscle surrounds the eyeball. the symptoms of brown syndrome are caused by abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. this results in the inability to move the affected eye upward. people with brown syndrome have limited eye movement in the affected eye. the ability to move the eyeball toward the center (adduction), or outward from the center (abduction), may be restricted or absent.  one eye may appear to be out of alignment with the unaffected eye, especially when looking upward.  the symptoms of brown syndrome may also include a droopy eyelid (ptosis), widening of the eye (palpebral fissure) when looking upward, crossing of the eyes (strabismus), and/or a backward head tilt.  a downward appearance (hypotropia) is usually present in the affected eye when the individual is looking straight ahead (primary position) or in an upward direction.  one eye is usually affected, but both eyes (bilateral) may be affected in approximately 10 percent of people with brown syndrome. brown syndrome is a rare eye disorder that affects slightly more females than males.  the symptoms of the congenital form of the disease are usually present at birth.  the acquired form may occur at any age.

Felty-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:felty syndrome is usually described as associated with or a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. this disorder is generally defined by the presence of three conditions: rheumatoid arthritis (ra), an enlarged spleen (spenomelgaly) and a low white blood cell count (neutropenia). the presence of ra gives rise to painful, stiff and swollen joints. a low white blood cell count, especially when accompanied by an abnormally large spleen, leads to a greater chance for infections. other symptoms associated with felty syndrome may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and/or discoloration of patches of skin (brown pigmentation). the exact cause of felty syndrome is unknown. it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder that may be genetically transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. it is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis are affected by felty syndrome.  this is a large number, but most of these go undiagnosed.  the disorder is about three times more common in women than in men.  felty syndrome is not found as frequently among those of african descent as among caucasian populations. the disorder generally affects persons 50 to 70 years of age. the differential diagnosis of felty syndrome may include sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, reactions to certain drugs, and/or myeloproliferative disorders.  (for more information on these disorders, choose ""sarcoidosis"" or ""amyloidosis"" as your search term in the rare disease database.) felty syndrome is usually diagnosed as a result of a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and the identification of the classic triad of physical findings (i.e. the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, low white blood count, and splenomegaly).

Moyamoya-Disease,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:""moyamoya disease is a progressive disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain (cerebrovascular). it is characterized by the narrowing (stenosis) and/or closing (occlusion) of the carotid artery inside the skull, a major artery that delivers blood to the brain. at the same time, tiny blood vessels at the base of the brain open up in an apparent attempt to supply blood to the brain distal to the blockage. these tiny vessels are the """"moyamoya"""" vessels for which the disease was named. inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya. one of the symptoms is typically stroke, which results in paralysis of the face, arms or legs, loss of speech, etc., or temporary loss of neurologic function of body parts or speech (transient ischemic attacks, or ""tia""). other symptoms that may result include headaches, visual disturbances, developmental delay, and seizures. approximately 10% of cases of moyamoya in asian countries have a genetic cause. patients with this arteriopathy that occurs either on a familial or idiopathic basis are said to have moyamoya disease. patients in whom the artery changes occur in association with another process such as sickle cell disease or down syndrome are said to have moyamoya disease. in this report, we use the term """"moyamoya disease"""" as shorthand for both forms. in japan, moyamoya disease typically occurs in females under the age of 20. in japan, the disease is estimated to occur in 1 per 300,000 people. although moyamoya was originally reported in individuals of japanese ancestry, cases have been reported from elsewhere in asia as well as from europe, north and south america, and most series reported in the western hemisphere have a minority of patients of asian descent.  of note, most patients in north america are isolated cases, with recent literature suggesting that less than 4% of cases in this population are familial. (gaillard 2017) in most patients, the diagnosis of moyamoya can be made from a careful assessment of an mri and mra. cerebral arteriography will confirm the diagnosis, establish the exact degree of blood vessel narrowing, demonstrate the existing blood flow patterns to various areas of the brain, and allow treatment decisions to be made; for these reasons, it is the standard diagnostic tool for this condition. in particular, catheter angiography can help with the identification of important blood vessels called ""transdural collaterals,"" which are present in some cases and can markedly influence surgical planning and prognosis.

document:onset of nec is typically during the first several weeks after birth when feeds have been started, and the age of onset inversely related to gestational age at birth. early in the disease process, neonates can exhibit signs of feeding intolerance with vomiting, increased gastric aspirates, bile-tinged (green) gastric aspirates, or decreased bowel sounds with abdominal distention and tenderness. gross or occult blood can be present in stools indicating mucosal injury. many of these signs are non-specific and can occur with other disorders. progression of nec results in systemic signs such as lethargy, long pauses in breathing called apnea, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (pumping of fluid through an organ or tissue.) ultimately this can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. a palpable mass and erythema (abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion, as in inflammation) of the abdominal wall is indicative of a more advanced disease process. nec affects 5 to 10% of premature infants born weighing less than 1500 g. among the risk factors defined for nec, prematurity and birth weight remain inversely related to risk for nec. term infants who develop nec usually have specific risk factors such as congenital heart disease, sepsis, and low blood pressure. many other gastrointestinal diseases can mimic nec, so when evaluating a patient it is important to consider and treat alternative etiologies. sepsis can cause an ileus with abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. premature infants, especially those on indomethacin or steroids can also present with spontaneous intestinal perforation (sip). sip is characterized by isolated perforation of the distal small bowel. other causes of severe abdominal distention in neonates include bowel obstruction from hirshsprung's disease, small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, and malrotation with volvulus. nec can also be mistaken for allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow's milk protein allergy. nec is diagnosed clinically and radiographically. once clinical suspicion arises, an abdominal x-ray is performed as an initial evaluation. this is repeated serially depending on acuity and clinical course to assess disease progression. characteristic findings on nec process on abdominal radiographs include pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), abnormal persistent dilated loops, thickened bowel wall, pneumoperitoneum and portal vein gas. pneumoperitoneum defined as abdominal free air is a surgical emergency indicating bowel perforation and usually requires intervention. abdominal ultrasonography can also be used to evaluate for free fluid in the abdominal cavity or abscess formation. addition laboratory studies to evaluate severity of nec include a blood culture, coagulation studies and complete blood count with manual differential to assess for leukocytosis with bandemia, neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. blood gases are checked serially to assess severity of acidosis and need for respiratory support or to assist with fluid management.

Anemia-Megaloblastic,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:megaloblastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). bone marrow, the soft spongy material found inside certain bones, produces the main blood cells of the body -red cells, white cells, and platelets. anemia is a condition characterized by the low levels of circulating, red blood cells. red blood cells are released from the marrow into the bloodstream where they travel throughout the body delivering oxygen to tissue. a deficiency in healthy, fully-matured red blood cells can result in fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness and additional findings. megaloblastic anemia has several different causes - deficiencies of either cobalamin (vitamin b12) or folate (vitamin b9) are the two most common causes. these vitamins play an essential role in the production of red blood cells. megaloblastic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. it can occur in individuals of any racial or ethnic background. because the causes of megaloblastic anemia vary and because some individuals may not exhibit any obvious symptoms (asymptomatic), determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of blood tests. blood tests may reveal the abnormally large, misshapen red blood cells that characterize megaloblastic anemia. blood tests can also confirm cobalamin or folate deficiency as the cause of megaloblastic anemia. additional tests such as a schilling test, which confirms poor absorption as the cause of cobalamin deficiency, may be necessary.

document:focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) is a term for a specific pattern of damage to the kidneys. the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs in the body, one on each side of the body just below the rib cage in the back. the kidney has multiple functions including filtering the blood of waste products and other substances and producing urine to carrying waste from the body. fsgs occurs when the filters of the kidney, which are made of clusters of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and known as renal glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis). each kidney has about a million glomeruli, which are part of a larger structure called the nephron; the nephron is the basic unit of the kidneys. the glomeruli help to filter out waste products and extra fluid from the blood. scarring or damage to the glomeruli can lead to an inability of the kidneys to process waste products and eliminate those waste products from the body through the urine. ultimately, these abnormalities lead to progressive kidney damage including decreased function and efficiency of the kidneys, and potentially kidney failure. there are different causes of fsgs and, in some instances, the cause is unknown. depending on the cause, fsgs may be treated with certain medications, but sometimes despite treatment affected individuals will eventually require dialysis or a kidney transplant.

(for further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use ""chromosome"" as your search term in the rare disease database.)

Glutaric-Aciduria-Type-I,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:glutaric aciduria type i (ga1) is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-coa dehydrogenase (gcdh). it is in the group of disorders known as cerebral organic acidemias. individuals with this condition have deficiency or absence of gcdh enzyme that is involved in the lysine metabolism. gcdh deficiency results in increased concentrations of potentially neurotoxic metabolites, glutaric acid (ga), 3-hydroxy glutaric acid (3-oh-ga) and glutaconic acid within body tissues, especially within the brain. two arbitrary biochemical subtypes have been defined, high (he) and low excretors (le), depending on the amount of ga in the urine. newborns may show unspecific clinical signs like enlarged head circumference (macrocephaly) or decreased muscle tone (hypotonia).  without treatment, most affected children develop an acute encephalopathic crisis following febrile illness episodes or other catabolic conditions resulting in bilateral striatal injury and consequently, dystonic movement disorder. cognitive outcome has not been systematically studied, but severe cognitive dysfunction is rarely seen. sometimes babies with ga1 have been mistaken to have been abused because they present with subdural and/or retinal hemorrhages. ga1 is included in the newborn screening panel in a growing number of countries which is essential for early intervention.  importantly, patients with the low excreting phenotype may be missed by newborn screening. ga1 is a rare inborn error of metabolism that affects males as often as females. it has been estimated that there are about 140 patients with this type of organic aciduria in the united states. ga1 occurs in approximately 1 of every 100,000 births. five genetic isolates are known with a high carrier frequency (up to 1:10) and incidence (up to 1:250 newborns): the old order amish community in lancaster county, pennsylvania, united states, the oji-cree first nations in manitoba and western ontario, canada, the irish travelers in the republic of ireland and united kingdom, the lumbee in north carolina, united states and the xhosa in south africa.

Dystonia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:dystonia is a general term for a large group of movement disorders that vary in their symptoms, causes, progression, and treatments. this group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). the muscular contractions may be sustained or come and go (intermittent). movements may be patterned and twisting, and/or in some cases shaking or quivering (tremulous) resembling a tremor. dystonia may occur or be worsened when an individual attempts a voluntary action. there are many different causes for dystonia. genetic as well as non-genetic factors can contribute to the development of these disorders. in some cases, the exact, underlying cause is unknown (idiopathic). the most characteristic finding associated with most forms of dystonia is twisting, repetitive movements that affect the neck, torso, limbs, eyes, face, vocal chords, and/or a combination of these muscle groups. certain forms such as laryngeal dystonia are not associated with abnormal postures. dystonia causes varying degrees of pain and disability that ranges from mild symptoms that come and go to severe, debilitating symptoms that can significantly affect a person's quality of life. in some cases dystonia can become progressively worse, while in others it remains unchanged or no longer worsens (plateaus). dystonia may even spontaneously remit in rare cases. treatment for dystonia depends upon several factors including the specific subtype present and can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy and surgery. dystonia can affect individuals of any age, gender, race, or ethnic background. it is estimated that as many as 300,000 people in north america may be affected by the various forms of dystonia. however, because many cases of dystonia go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of dystonia in the general population is difficult. focal forms of dystonia are approximately 10 times more common than generalized forms.

document:homocystinuria is a rare metabolic condition characterized by an excess of the compound homocystine in the urine. the condition may result from deficiency of any of several enzymes involved in the conversion of the essential amino acid methionine to another amino acid (cysteine)--or, less commonly, impaired conversion of the compound homocysteine to methionine. enzymes are proteins that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions in the body. certain amino acids, which are the chemical building blocks of proteins, are essential for proper growth and development. in most cases, homocystinuria is caused by reduced activity of an enzyme known as cystathionine beta-synthase (cbs). infants who develop homocystinuria due to cbs deficiency (which is also known as classical homocystinuria) may fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and have developmental delays.

document:although retinoblastoma is a rare disorder, it is the most common cancer of the eye in children, accounting for about 3% of all childhood malignancies. retinoblastoma affects males slightly more often than females. the incidence in the united states and europe is estimated to be 2-5 children per 1,000,000 people in the general population. the age-adjusted annual incidence for children aged 0-4 in the united states is 10-14 children per 1,000,000. this equates to about 1 in 14,000-18,000 live births. incidence is the number of newly diagnosed people with a disorder identified in a given year. two-thirds of children are affected before the age of 2 and more than 90% of retinoblastomas become apparent before the age of five years. the diagnosis of retinoblastoma is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, the identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. the presenting symptom is usually leukocoria. a complete examination of the interior of the eye (fundoscopic examination under anesthesia - eua) may be performed to locate the presence of a tumor or tumors. magnetic resonance imaging (mris) may be used to determine the extent of the tumor(s) and determine if the tumor has spread to surrounding structures or tissue. ultrasonography may be used to rule out other conditions. computed tomography (ct) scans are generally avoided because of the potential risk of additional radiation-induced tumors if the child has hereditary retinoblastoma.

Biliary-Atresia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:biliary atresia is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by destruction or absence of all or a portion of the bile duct that lies outside the liver (extrahepatic bile duct). the bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. in biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver. affected infants have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and scarring of the liver (fibrosis). in some cases, additional abnormalities may be present, including heart defects and intestinal, spleen and kidney malformations. the exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown. biliary atresia is a rare disorder with a slight increased frequency in females. it occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 births in the united states. approximately 400-600 new cases of biliary atresia are encountered in the united states each year. according to one estimate, the prevalence of biliary atresia in europe is approximately 1 in 12,000 births. biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. the diagnosis of biliary atresia requires a direct examination of the bile ducts by abdominal surgery (laparotomy) and the microscopic examination of tissue from the liver (liver biopsy). during the surgery special contrast dye is injected into the gallbladder and x-ray films are taken to outline how the dye fills the major bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiogram). these films show the movement (or lack of movement) of the dye through bile ducts and into the small intestine. the physician/surgeon is then able to evaluate the structure of the bile ducts and to determine the site of the blockage (proximal or distal). blood tests may demonstrate elevated levels of liver enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin and detect viral agents; high blood levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 has been discovered to be highly specific for biliary atresia. ultrasound of the liver may show absence of the gall bladder.

document:x-linked ichthyosis is a genetic skin disorder that affects males. it is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid sulfatase. under normal conditions, this enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) cholesterol sulfate, a member of the chemical family of steroids. cholesterol sulfate plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the skin. if steroid metabolism is interrupted and cholesterol sulfate accumulates in the skin cells, the skin cells stick together more strongly than usual. the normal shedding of dead skin cells is inhibited and the skin cells build up and clump into scales. x-linked recessive disorders are conditions that are coded on the x chromosome.  females have two x chromosomes; males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome.  therefore, in females, the normal gene on one x chromosome can mask disease traits on the other x chromosome.  since males have only one x chromosome, if they inherit the gene for a disease present on the x they will express the disease.  men with x-linked disorders transmit the gene to all their daughters, who are carriers, but never to their sons.  women who are carriers of an x-linked disorder have a 50 percent chance of transmitting the carrier condition to their daughters and a 50 percent risk of transmitting the disease to their sons. x-linked ichthyosis is a rare disorder affecting one in 6,000 males.

Retinitis-Pigmentosa,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:retinitis pigmentosa (rp) comprises a large group of inherited vision disorders that cause progressive degeneration of the retina, the light sensitive membrane that coats the inside of the eyes. peripheral (or side) vision gradually decreases and eventually is lost in most cases. central vision is usually preserved until late in these conditions. some forms of rp can be associated with deafness, obesity, kidney disease, and various other general health problems, including central nervous system and metabolic disorders, and occasionally chromosomal abnormalities. rp as a group of vision disorders affects about 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 people in the world. this means that, with a population of about 324 million in the united states in mid-july 2017 (see < http://www.census.gov/> for continuous updates), about 81,000 to 108,000 people in the united states have rp or a related disorder. with a worldwide population presently estimated at over 7.05 billion, it can be estimated that approximately 1.77 to 2.35 million people around the world have one of these disorders. excluding age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, the genetic causes of which are complex and linked simultaneously to more than one gene (so called ""polygenic"" disorders), rp is the most common cause of inherited visual loss. rp is diagnosed by electroretinography (erg) showing progressive loss in photoreceptor function, visual field testing, and retinal imaging [mainly by optical coherence tomography (oct) and fundus auto-fluorescence (faf) that show detailed microanatomical features that cannot be resolved by naked eye]. molecular genetic testing for mutations in many of the genes associated with rp is available to confirm the diagnosis.

(2) chronic kidney disease develops. this initially is noticed as an elevated blood creatinine level. there are no symptoms from an elevated creatinine until it is very high, so often the elevated creatinine is found out on blood testing at a doctor's office or in the hospital. often, doctors are uncertain why the creatinine is elevated.  as chronic kidney disease progresses, and the creatinine rises more, patients develop symptoms of fatigue, anemia, and feel cold all the time. decreased appetite and fluid retention develop as the patient nears the need for dialysis. (3) dialysis or kidney transplant is required sometime between the 4th and 7th decade of life. (4) several types of the disease are associated with elevated uric acid concentrations in blood and gout, which sometimes starts in the teenage years. in adtkd-umod and adtkd- ren, some - but not all - family members are affected by gout. all types of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease are very uncommon.

Prolactinoma,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:a prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland (adenoma) that produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. in women, hyperprolactinemia is characterized by irregular menstrual periods or even absence of periods, infertility and production of breast milk in women who are not pregnant (galactorrhea). the most common symptom in men is impotence. the cause of pituitary tumors is unknown. most pituitary tumors are sporadic and not associated with genetic factors that are inherited or can be passed on to children. pituitary tumors that produce enough prolactin to affect health occur in approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. all patients who are shown to have a pituitary adenoma on mri or ct imaging should have a serum prolactin level checked and if their prolactin level is >150-200 ng/ml the patient likely harbors a prolactin secreting tumor which should be treated with a dopamine agonist medication rather than surgery. if the level is less, this could be due to a tumor <10 mm or lack of normal inhibition by hypothalamic dopamine which then permits the normal prolactin secreting cells to hypersecrete (stalk effect). the effect of certain medications, recreational drugs, macroprolactin (big prolactin molecule with no effect on the body), other medical conditions (like low thyroid function, hepatic or renal insufficiency) should be evaluated for these lower levels. a specialist consultation should be considered for such patients by an experienced endocrinologist. prolactinoma is treated with medications that act like dopamine (dopamine agonists) such as bromocriptine, quinagolide and cabergoline because dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. these medications reduce the size of the tumor and reduce the amount of prolactin secretion in approximately 80-90% of patients. surgery may be recommended if medical therapy is not effective or bothersome side effects (dizziness, mental fogginess, nausea, vomiting). for both medical therapy and surgery, cure rates depend on the size and location of the tumor and the prolactinoma can recur in some affected individuals. radiation therapy is sometimes used to control growth of a prolactinoma if no response to medications and not amenable to surgery.

Hepatic-Encephalopathy,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:hepatic encephalopathy is a brain disorder that develops in some individuals with liver disease. hepatic encephalopathy is a complex disorder that encompasses a spectrum or continuum of disease that ranges from a subtle condition with no outward signs or symptoms to a severe form that can cause serious, life-threatening complications. symptoms are related to progressive dysfunction of the brain and may include personality changes, intellectual impairment, impaired memory and loss of consciousness (coma). hepatic encephalopathy can occur in individuals with acute or chronic liver (hepatic) disease or in individuals whose liver is bypassed by a portosystemic shunt (with no liver disease present). a portosystemic shunt is an abnormal passageway that allows blood from the gastrointestinal tract to bypass the liver. they can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired during life. hepatic encephalopathy is caused when toxins that are normally cleared from the body by the liver accumulate in the blood, eventually traveling to the brain. many of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are reversible when promptly detected and treated. a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy may be suspected in some individuals with liver disease based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests that are used to rule out other conditions. such tests may include a complete blood count, liver function tests, tests that evaluate serum ammonia levels, and an electroencephalogram, which is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain, may be useful in detecting encephalopathy. specialized imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and computed tomography (ct) scans may be used to rule out other conditions affecting the brain such as tumors.

document:at this time, clinicians believe that an as yet unknown immunological process is the preferred explanation for the cause of most cases of endomyocardial fibrosis and loeffler's disease. in the past, the cause of both conditions was attributed to the presence of the filaria worm in patients or to poor nutrition. widespread infection with such worms and poor diets are typical in the tropical regions in which these disorders are more common. eosinophils have been observed in some cases of endomyocardial fibrosis, suggesting a form of hypersensitivity may play a role in select cases. in children, endomyocardial fibrosis has been associated with the mumps virus. endomyocardial fibrosis is principally an endemic disease of the equatorial tropics. it is exceedingly rare in europe and north america. it affects all races, mostly children and young adults. the disease has been described in a few patients over 60 years of age and, rarely, in patients younger than 5 years of age. echocardiography is the primary tool used to diagnose suspected cases of endomyocardial fibrosis or loeffler's disease. a heart muscle biopsy is sometimes obtained to confirm the diagnosis.

Hypokalemia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:hypokalemia is a metabolic imbalance characterized by extremely low potassium levels in the blood. it is a symptom of another disease or condition, or a side effect of diuretic drugs. the body needs potassium for the contraction of muscles (including the heart), and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. the normal concentration of potassium in the body is regulated by the kidneys through the excretion of urine. when the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. body chemicals and hormones such as aldosterone also regulate potassium balance. secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. when hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium. hypokalemia may affect both males and females.  however, it occurs more commonly in females. the underlying cause of hypokalemia must first be treated. when the hypokalemia is severe, potassium chloride may be administered orally or intravenously. treatment must be carefully monitored by a physician. any associated acid-base disorders or hormonal disturbances must be evaluated before treatment is planned. the administration of potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics is usually discouraged in patients with kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system. the imbalance of external and internal potassium levels in these individuals may predispose them to life-threatening degrees of hyperkalemia (too much potassium). hypokalemia in individuals with high blood pressure taking diuretics may be improved by replacing lost potassium in the diet through certain fruits or potassium drugs. hypokalemia may also be minimized by dietary restriction of salt since high rates of sodium excretion promote urinary potassium losses. people who participate in vigorous sports or exercise in warm weather should be sure to replace potassium that is lost through excessive sweating. this can be accomplished through dietary planning.

Epidermal-Nevus-Syndromes,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:epidermal nevus syndromes (enss) are a group of rare complex disorders characterized by the presence of skin lesions known as epidermal nevi associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities, most often affecting the brain, eye and skeletal systems. epidermal nevi are overgrowths of structures and tissue of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. the different types of epidermal nevi can vary in size, number, location, distribution and appearance. neurological abnormalities that can be associated with enss can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs). ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, clouding (opacity) of the cornea or partial absence of tissue of the iris or retina (colobomas). endocrine abnormalities such as vitamin d-resistant rickets have been associated with schimmelpenning syndrome. the specific symptoms and severity of enss can vary greatly from one person to another. most enss occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). epidermal nevi (including as an isolated finding) have been reported to occur in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births. the percentage of individuals with epidermal nevi who also have extra-cutaneous malformations is much lower but likewise unknown. the prevalence and incidence of individual enss is unknown. a diagnosis of an epidermal nevus syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history and a thorough clinical evaluation. in some cases, a small sample of affected skin may be taken for microscopic study (biopsy). additional tests may be required to detect the presence and extent of associated symptoms. such tests include a skeletal survey, chest x-rays and specialized imaging techniques to evaluate the brain. such imaging techniques may include computerized tomography (ct) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (mri). whether a child with an epidermal nevus should undergo such imaging techniques is controversial. some researchers believe that these tests should be avoided unless there are clinical signs of central nervous involvement. in three of the well-defined enss (type 2 segmental cowden disease, garcia-hafner-happle syndrome, child syndrome), molecular testing is now possible.

document:congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) is a group of rare inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of one of the enzymes needed to make specific hormones. cah effects the adrenal glands located at the top of each kidney. normally, the adrenal glands are responsible for producing three different hormones: 1. corticosteroids, which gauge the body's response to illness or injury; 2. mineralocorticoids, which regulate salt and water levels; and 3. androgens, which are male sex hormones. an enzyme deficiency will make the body unable to produce one or more of these hormones, which in turn will result in the overproduction of another type of hormone precursor in order to compensate for the loss. the most common form of cah, 21 hydroxylase deficiency, affects approximately 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the united states and europe. among the yupik eskimos, the occurrence of the salt-wasting form of this disorder may be as high as 1 in 282 individuals. other forms of cah are much rarer. in contrast, non-classical cah affects approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 individuals in the general population.

document:gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) belong to a group of cancers known as soft tissue sarcomas. the number of new cases in the united states annually has been estimated to be 5,000-6,000. tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. there are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). there are also case reports of tumors arising in the appendix and/or pancreas. these tumors most commonly present with abdominal pain, bleeding or signs of intestinal obstruction. they spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. some gists are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, kit or pdgfr, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. there are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). most cases arise in older adults. leiomyosarcomas of the intestinal tract arise in a similar location and can be confused with gist. leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. there are essentially two types of muscles in the body - voluntary and involuntary. smooth muscles are involuntary muscles - the brain has no conscious control over them. smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. for example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. leiomyosarcoma usually spreads via the bloodstream. it is very rare to see it in lymphatics. since smooth muscle is found all over the body, a leiomyosarcoma can form almost anywhere where there are blood vessels, heart, liver, pancreas, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract, the space behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum), uterus, skin. the uterus is the most common location for a leiomyosarcoma. most leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are now reclassified as gists. the exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown. (for more information on these tumors, choose ""leiomyosarcoma"" as your search term in the rare disease database.)

Anemia-of-Chronic-Disease,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:anemia of chronic disease, also called the anemia of inflammation, is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. anemia is characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. in mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness. the underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood. anemia of chronic disease varies in severity from one person to another. in most cases, anemia is usually mild or moderate. affected individuals may develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, irritability, chest pain and additional findings. these symptoms may occur in any individual who has a comparable degree of anemia. in most cases, the symptoms associated with the underlying disease usually take precedent over the mild or moderate anemia symptoms. in rare cases, anemia of chronic disease can be severe and cause more serious complications. anemia of chronic disease affects males and females in equal proportion. individuals of any age who have a chronic, inflammatory condition can potentially develop the condition. the exact incidence of anemia of chronic disease is unknown and some researchers believe that it is underreported or often goes unrecognized. anemia of chronic disease is believed to be the second most common cause of anemia in the united states after iron-deficiency anemia. a diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. such tests can measure the levels of certain substances in the body including hemoglobin levels, the levels of iron in the serum, total iron binding capacity, overall red blood cell count, or normal or increased levels of ferritin in the blood. ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body's iron stores in the blood plasma. another test that may be performed measures transferrin saturation. transferrin is a protein that is involved in the transport of iron from the intestines into the bloodstream. methods to allow the reliable measurement of hepcidin in plasma have been developed but are not available or approved for use in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease at present.

document:myoclonus is the term used to describe the sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles caused by muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or muscle relaxation (negative myoclonus). the twitching or jerking of muscles cannot be controlled by the person experiencing it. myoclonic jerks may occur infrequently or many times a minute. they sometimes occur in response to an external event or when a person attempts to make a movement. by itself, myoclonus may be seen as a symptom rather than a disease. to some degree, it may occur occasionally to otherwise healthy people. (for instance, hiccups may be considered a type of myoclonus.) in severe cases, it can interfere with movement control and balance, and limit various everyday activities such as eating or talking. myoclonus affects males and females in equal numbers. some forms of myoclonus are common and some forms are rare. in general, the incidence of myoclonus is 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, and the prevalence is 8.6 cases per 100,000 populations.

ACTH-Deficiency,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:acth deficiency arises as a result of decreased or absent production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) by the pituitary gland. a decline in the concentration of acth in the blood leads to a reduction in the secretion of adrenal hormones, resulting in adrenal insufficiency (hypoadrenalism). adrenal insufficiency leads to weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure (hypotension). because these symptoms are so general, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed or missed entirely. for that reason, some clinicians believe the disorder to be more common than previously thought. symptoms of acth deficiency most often occur in adults, but the disorder may also be diagnosed in infancy. the disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. when acth deficiency is suspected, blood samples are taken for analysis, especially of the level of cortisol in the blood. cortisol is the name of one of the hormones produced by the outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal glands. if the concentration of cortisol is low, it typically indicates a low concentration of acth. on occasion, an acth stimulation test may be administered.
