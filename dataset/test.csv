Chromosome-6-Partial-Trisomy-6q,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the 6th chromosome (6q) is present three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. associated symptoms and findings may vary in range and severity from case to case. however, many affected infants and children have slow physical development (growth retardation); mental retardation; malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; an unusually short, webbed neck; abnormal bending (flexion) or extension of certain joints in fixed postures (joint contractures); and/or other physical abnormalities. in most cases, chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q has been the result of a balanced translocation in one of the parents. chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those potentially associated with chromosome 6, partial trisomy 6q.  chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (for further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use ""chromosome"" as your search term in the rare disease database.)

Arteriovenous-Malformation,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:arteriovenous malformation (avm) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. in the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. brain avms are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. the distribution of age at detection for brain avms is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30's. although a small number of avms manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. the lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. the low resistance of the direct a-v connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the avm. these high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the avm and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. further, because of the direct a-v connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the avm and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. avm can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. avm are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. no environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological avm. avm does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of avms may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-avm syndrome. avm can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as wyburn-mason syndrome. avm affects males and females in equal numbers. there does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. the best estimates for new detection of an avm are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the u.s.) the population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the u.s. who harbor an avm or have had an avm that was treated. they occur throughout life, but the peak onset of symptoms is 35-40 years of age.

Pseudo-Hurler-Polydystrophy,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:pseudo-hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis type iii) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a defective enzyme known as upd-n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. this defective enzyme ultimately results in the accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) and fatty substances (mucolipids) in various tissues of the body. the symptoms of this disorder are similar, but less severe than those of i-cell disease (mucolipidosis type ii) and may include progressive joint stiffness, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and/or skeletal deformities of the hands (e.g., claw-hands). growth delays accompanied by deterioration of the hip joints typically develop in children with pseudo-hurler polydystrophy. additional symptoms may include clouding of the corneas of the eyes, mild to moderate coarseness of facial features, mild mental retardation, easy fatigability, and/or heart disease. pseudo-hurler polydystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. a diagnosis of pseudo-hurler polydystrophy may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. a variety of specialized tests may confirm a diagnosis. these tests include detecting elevated lysosomal enzyme activity in serum or decreased enzyme levels in white blood cells or cultured connective tissue cells (fibroblasts).

C3-Glomerulopathy_-Dense-Deposit-Disease-and-C3-Glomerulonephritis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:over the past decade, important advances in our understanding of complement-mediated renal diseases have led to the adoption of new names or 'disease categories' to more precisely group diseases that appear to share a similar cause. consider, for example, dense deposit disease (ddd), a very rare kidney disease characterized on a renal biopsy test called 'immunofluorescence' by an abundance of a protein called c3 in the renal glomeruli, and named for the extremely dense 'sausage-like' deposits that are seen in the glomerular basement membrane (gbm) using electron microscopy. in 2013, as a result of a consensus meeting, scientists recommended that ddd be sub-grouped under a new heading - c3 glomerulopathy, abbreviated c3g. the adoption of this new term was driven by the recognition that there is another group of patients with glomerular disease whose kidney biopsy is reminiscent of ddd. on electron microscopy, the deposits in these patients are lighter in color and more widespread in location, but on immunofluorescence, as with ddd there is an abundance of c3 in the renal glomeruli. these patients are said to have c3 glomerulonephritis or c3gn.  in recognition of shared similarities, both ddd and c3gn are now classified as sub-types of c3g. c3g affects persons of all ages, although the mean age appears to be lower in ddd patients as compared to c3gn patients. the prevalence of c3g is estimated at 2-3 per 1,000,000 people. c3g can only be diagnosed by a kidney biopsy. the kidney deposits stain for the complement protein c3 and when examined under an electron microscope, dense deposits are present.

Alpers-Disease,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:alpers disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that begins during childhood and is complicated in many instances by serious liver disease. symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia). alpers disease usually begins during early childhood, usually indicated by seizures at any age between 3 months and 5 years.  it is characterized by lack of coordination of motor movement, partial paralysis, seizures, and muscle twitching. the child is unable to achieve normal muscle tone (hypotonia), yet the limbs appear to be stiff. on mri examination an increased density of the grey matter in the brain is noted. usually, but not always, alpers disease is associated with liver damage.  mental retardation may be severe and is progressive.  the loss of intellectual functions such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning may also interfere with a person's daily functioning (dementia).   in later stages, patients may lose control of the movement of their arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). the liver may become cirrhotic and fail completely, or may not progress beyond signs of jaundice. affected individuals may also become blind as a result of optic atrophy as the optic nerve degenerates. it is thought that alpers disease affects males and females in equal numbers usually during early childhood.  however, some clinicians are convinced that the difficulty of diagnosis makes estimating the frequency of this disorder less accurate.  it is probable that alpers disease affects fewer, than one (1) person per 200,000 of population.

document:dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (deh), also known as trevor's disease, is a developmental bone disease of childhood. it is rare and clinical experience with this condition is limited. most cases are diagnosed before 8 years of age. it is characterized by an abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, particularly of the lower limbs. the bones of the knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected, as well as part of the foot (tarsal bones). the upper limbs and spine are rarely involved. the abnormal cartilage produces an irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone (hemimelic), usually medial. deh may affect a single bone (localized form), multiple bones in a single limb (classical form) or an entire limb (generalized) usually involving a leg from the pelvis to the foot. approximately two-thirds of affected children have multiple lesions. deh was first described in the medical literature in 1926. trevor recognized this condition in 1950. the name, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica first appeared in the medical literature in 1956. the cause of deh is unknown. there is no evidence that hereditary factors play a role in the development of this disease. more research is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause(s) of this disorder. deh is benign and there are no reports of malignant transformation of the cartilage abnormality. deh usually affects children between the ages of 1 and 15. males are affected more often than females. the incidence of deh has been estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. however, some authors consider that the incidence is probably higher because some patients may be misdiagnosed with other conditions.

document:batten turner type congenital myopathy is an extremely rare, inherited muscle disease (myopathy) and is characterized by the lack of muscle tone or floppiness at birth (congenital hypotonia). the symptoms of batten turner type congenital myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood. however, this disorder is not progressive in adulthood. the first symptoms of batten turner type congenital myopathy in a newborn are the slow, progressive loss of muscle tone characterized by floppiness (hypotonia) and general weakness.  early motor skills and other important developmental milestones may be slightly delayed.  toddlers with this disorder usually have mild muscle weakness and may be prone to falling or stumbling.  the muscles of the pelvis, neck, and shoulder area are most commonly affected.  since the symptoms of this disease are not progressive during adulthood, most people with batten turner type congenital myopathy walk normally as adults.  however, some physical activities may be slightly impaired. batten turner type congenital myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.  human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  in recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  if an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  the risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  the risk is the same for each pregnancy. batten turner type congenital myopathy is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  the symptoms of this disorder are most obvious during infancy and childhood.  nine cases of batten turner type congenital myopathy have been described in the medical literature.  six of these cases were reported in one family. adults with batten turner type congenital myopathy should be encouraged to get adequate exercise and to avoid obesity. affected adults may experience episodes of mild muscle weakness, but generally there are no major physical disabilities.

Waldenstrom_s-Macroglobulinemia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (wmg) is a malignant disorder of the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues, a type of lymphoma and characterized by the presence of abnormally large numbers of a particular kind of white blood cell known as b lymphocytes. as these cells accumulate in the body, excessive quantities of an antibody protein known as igm are produced. large amounts of igm cause the blood to become thick (hyperviscosity) and affects the flow of blood through the smaller blood vessels, leading to some of the symptoms of the disorder. small blood vessels may tear leading to bleeding in the nose, gums, or retina. symptoms of waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia usually begin gradually. common symptoms are fatigue and loss of energy due to anemia. bleeding from the nose and gums may also occur, and tingling in the fingers and toes is often seen (peripheral neuropathy). examination may also reveal enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. blurring or vision impairment may also occur due to changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina. the symptoms are quite variable depending on the effect of the thickened (viscous) blood on the organ involved. the causes of waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia are unknown. there is evidence of occurrence within families, but such occurrence is uncommon. waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 3.4 million american men and about half that number of american women. the incidence of wmg is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000,000 people over the age of 50. the median age at diagnosis is 67. however, cases have been diagnosed in patients in their twenties. this disorder is considerably less common among people of african descent. when patients show symptoms of an enlarged spleen and liver combined with bleeding of the retina, wmg is reasonably suspected. the results of a complete blood count (cbc) usually show low red blood cell counts as well as low platelet counts. in such circumstances, electrophoresis (subjecting blood plasma to an electric impulse) of serum samples will show a peak reading for igm.

Jejunal-Atresia,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:jejunal atresia is a rare genetic disorder. patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. as a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. jejunal atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  in recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  if an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  the risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  the risk is the  same for each pregnancy. jejunal atresia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  there have been approximately 57 cases reported in the medical literature.

Hypoplastic-Left-Heart-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). the normal heart has four chambers. the two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. the two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. the valves allow for blood to be pumped through the chambers. blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. the blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. the left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). the aorta sends the blood throughout the body. hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males (67 percent) more often than females. the estimated prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 100,000 live births. hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 7-9 percent of all congenital heart defects. the symptoms of this disorder are present at birth (congenital). the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests. such tests used to confirm hypoplastic left heart syndrome in newborns include x-ray examination and a special ultrasound test to study the structure and function of the heart (echocardiography).

document:townes-brocks syndrome (tbs) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. abnormalities in the feet, heart and kidneys also occur frequently. townes-brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the sall1 gene. the absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus) is the most common feature of tbs.   small ears and a folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear are usually present.  congenital sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss can range from mild to severe and can be progressive.   the most common thumb malformations are three bones instead of two (triphalangeal thumbs) and duplicated thumbs (preaxial polydactyly).  feet anomalies occur less frequently and include a short third toe, overlapping toes and flat feet.  kidney dysfunction can occur with or without kidney malformations.   typical kidney anomalies include displaced or rotated kidneys, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, and underdeveloped kidneys.  abnormalities of the heart, eye and spine are infrequently associated with townes-brocks syndrome.  mental retardation occurs in approximately 10% of affected individuals. townes-brocks syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease.  the sall1 gene is the only gene known to be associated with townes-brocks syndrome.  the abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.  approximately 50% of affected individuals have the condition as a result of a new mutation.  the risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. the prevalence of townes-brock syndrome is not known but has been estimated to be at least 1 in 250,000 births.  this condition affects males and females in equal numbers. the diagnosis of townes-brocks syndrome is based on clinical symptoms. molecular genetic testing for mutations in the sall1 gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.

document:cat eye syndrome (ces) is a rare chromosomal disorder that may be evident at birth. individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. however, in individuals with ces, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. in a small number of people with ces, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  the name ""cat eye syndrome"" is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. this defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat's eye. there are, however, many other features associated with ces involving many organs and systems. these symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. ces may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. while some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. ces has been recognized for more than a century. more than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. however, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of ces in the population. schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in northeastern switzerland. because some affected individuals develop few associated features, however, the disorder may in some people remain unrecognized. there is currently no way to estimate how underdiagnosed this syndrome is.

Empty-Sella-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:empty sella syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by enlargement or malformation of a structure in the skull known as the sella turcica. the sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression located in the bone at the base of skull (sphenoid bone), in which resides the pituitary gland. in empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid and a very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella (partially empty sella) or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland (completely empty sella). most individuals with empty sella syndrome do not have any associated symptoms, but the finding raises concerns about hormone deficiencies. empty sella syndrome may occur as a primary disorder, for which the cause is unknown (idiopathic), or as a secondary disorder, in which it occurs due to an underlying condition or disorder such as a treated pituitary tumor, head trauma, or a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also called pseudotumor cerebri) during which elevated intracranial pressure causes empty sella syndrome. primary empty sella syndrome affects approximately 4 times more women than men. most cases occur in middle-aged women who are obese and have high blood pressure (hypertension). because most people with empty sella syndrome do not have symptoms and may go undiagnosed, determining the disorder's true frequency in the general population is difficult. some researchers have estimated that less than 1 percent of individuals with empty sella syndrome ultimately develop symptoms associated with the disorder, although this may be higher in men compared to women. a diagnosis of empty sella syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized imaging techniques. imaging may include computerized tomography (ct) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (mri). during ct scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. an mri uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs, tissues and structures such as the sella turcica.

Schindler-disease,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:schindler disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-naga or alpha-galactosidase b). the enzyme defect leads to the abnormal accumulation of certain complex compounds (glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides), which have terminal or preterminal n-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in many tissues of the body and in urine. two major forms of schindler disease exist - a severe form with onset in infancy (type i) and a milder form with onset in adulthood (type ii). some researchers have proposed a type iii form of schindler disease that is less severe than type i, but more severe than type ii. the specific symptoms and severity of schindler disease can vary from one person to another. schindler disease is caused by mutations of the naga gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. schindler disease affects males and females in equal numbers. the exact incidence of schindler disease in the general population is unknown. because cases of schindler disease may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder's true frequency in the general population is difficult. as a group, lysosomal storage diseases are infrequent, although certain disorders may occur in specific ethnic or demographic groups at higher frequencies, about one in every 1,000-2,000 live births for gaucher and fabry diseases, or very infrequently (1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births) for most of these disorders, which may be the case for alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. schindler disease was first reported in the medical literature in the late 1980s.

Pseudocholinesterase-Deficiency,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that makes an affected person very sensitive to any of several anesthetic agents, especially those derived from the drug known as choline. when anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum.  if the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea).  artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing.  if the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the united states.  among caucasian americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep.  infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant's sleep.  apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing.  when there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea.  central apnea followed by or intermixed with an obstructive apnea is called mixed apnea.
