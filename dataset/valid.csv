Williams-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:williams syndrome, also known as williams-beuren syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation), short stature, a varying degree of mental deficiency, and distinctive facial features that typically become more pronounced with age. such characteristic facial features may include a round face, full cheeks, thick lips, a large mouth that is usually held open, and a broad nasal bridge with nostrils that flare forward (anteverted nares). affected individuals may also have unusually short eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), flared eyebrows, a small lower jaw (mandible), and prominent ears. dental abnormalities may also occur including abnormally small, underdeveloped teeth (hypodontia) with small, slender roots. williams syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and infants of any race may be affected. the prevalence of this disorder is approximately one in 10,000-20,000 births in the united states. the diagnosis of williams syndrome may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation that includes a detailed patient history and specialized blood tests that may detect elevated levels of calcium in the blood. another test, known as fluorescent in situ hybridization [fish], may be used to determine whether a deletion of one elastin gene on chromosome 7 is present. this deletion is believed to occur in the majority of individuals with williams syndrome.

Truncus-Arteriosus,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) in which there is a single main blood vessel, rather than the normal two, carrying blood away from the heart. instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body. babies with this condition may have a bluish tint (cyanosis) to their skin, lips, and fingernails. in most cases, truncus arteriosus occurs in conjunction with a missing upper portion of the wall between the ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). the exact cause of truncus arteriosus is not known.  it has been suggested that some cases may develop due to the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).  the malformation is the result of an error in embryonic development.  approximately 35 percent of children with this disorder also have digeorge syndrome, which is a severe congenital immune deficiency disorder involving the thymus and parathyroid glands.  (for more information on digeorge syndrome, see the related disorders section of this report.) the diagnosis of truncus arteriosus is confirmed by clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (ekg), and specialized imaging techniques that allow the physician to view the structure of the heart. these may include an echocardiogram, angiocardiogram, and/or cardiac catheterization.

Vasculitis,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:the specific underlying cause of vasculitis is not fully understood. however, in most cases, vasculitis is thought to be due to disturbances of the body's immune system. some forms of vasculitis may be due to allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to certain medications such as sulfur drugs, penicillin, propylthiouracil, other drugs, toxins, or other inhaled environmental irritants. other forms may occur due to fungal, parasitic, or viral infections. in some instances, it is thought that vasculitis may be an autoimmune disorder. autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses against ""foreign"" or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. because of the wide range of symptoms and body systems involved, an extensive history and physical exam is needed before a clear diagnosis of the type of vasculitis can be made. in some cases, an x-ray of the blood vessels using dye (angiogram), or a biopsy of the affected organ may be recommended to give an accurate diagnosis and to insure proper treatment.

document:trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type i (trps1) is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. trps1 is characterized by thin, sparse scalp hair, unusual facial features, abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes, and multiple abnormalities of the ""growing ends"" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. characteristic facial features may include a rounded (bulbous) ""pear-shaped"" nose, an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), dental anomalies, and/or unusually large (prominent) ears. in most cases, the fingers and/or toes may be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and curved. in addition, affected individuals may exhibit short stature. the range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. in most cases, trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type i has autosomal dominant inheritance. trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type i is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. in those individuals with mild symptoms, a diagnosis may be easily missed or go unreported. therefore, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population. many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of trps1 than is actually reported in the medical literature. the diagnosis of trps1 may be suspected upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., rounded [bulbous] nose; thin, sparse hair; etc.). the diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and x-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal distinctive abnormalities of the hands and feet (e.g., epiphyseal coning). molecular genetic testing can reveal mutations of the trps1 gene.

document:smith-lemli-opitz syndrome (slos) is a variable genetic disorder that is characterized by slow growth before and after birth, small head (microcephaly), mild to moderate mental retardation and multiple birth defects including particular facial features, cleft palate, heart defects, fused second and third toes, extra fingers and toes and underdeveloped external genitals in males.  the severity of slos varies greatly in affected individuals, even in the same family, and some have normal development and only minor birth defects. slos is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that results in an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism.  slos is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. for the us the birth prevalence of slos has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 live births.  the predicted prevalence based on newborn screening for gene carriers is estimated to be 1 in 1,590 to 13,500 and this discrepancy may be due to the fact that many fetuses with slos are stillborn.   this condition occurs equally in males and females but females are often not diagnosed because genital abnormalities are missed.  slos occurs more often in individuals of european ancestry. the diagnosis of slos is based on physical findings and detection of an elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-dhc) in blood serum or an elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol:cholesterol ratio. molecular genetic testing for mutations in the dhcr7 gene is available and is mainly used for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.

document:whipple disease is a rare disease resulting from bacterial infection that leads to inadequate absorption of nutrients (malabsorption) from the intestine. it is believed to result from infection with bacteria known as tropheryma whippelii. the infection usually involves the small intestine, but over time, the disease may affect various parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and eyes. whipple disease is caused by a rod-shaped bacterium called tropheryma whippelii.  this bacterium was first identified in 1991/92.  its natural habitats are unknown, but it appears likely that infection occurs by way of an environmental source and that the bacteria are introduced into the body through the mouth (peroral). whipple disease affects more males than females in a ratio of approximately 4 to 1.  the symptoms of this disorder typically begin between the ages of thirty and sixty years.  the age range of those affected is thought to be between 30 and 80, with the median age at time of diagnosis being 56 years.  most of the cases of whipple disease have been diagnosed among europeans and  americans of european parentage.  in germany, the disease incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million population per year.  a few cases have been reported among american indians and americans of african descent. in 2004, for the first time, a case of whipple disease was reported in japan. the standard diagnostic approach is to study a tissue sample (biopsy) from the small intestine. blood testing can determine whether anemia is present. confirmation of diagnosis can be achieved either by electron microscopy or by a test known as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis, which detects the dna of t. whippelii.

Superior-Semicircular-Canal-Dehiscence,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:superior semicircular canal dehiscence (sscd) has been defined as the absence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal facing toward the dura of the middle cranial fossa. sscd has been implicated as the cause of a variety of inner ear symptoms including tullio's phenomenon, pressure induced vertigo, aural fullness, autophony, conductive hearing loss, and fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss. additionally, sscd has also been reported to be asymptomatic. in the past, many patients with sscd had been misdiagnosed as having otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tubes, middle ear perilymphatic fistulas, or meniere's disease. identification of this entity requires a high degree of suspicion, appropriate findings on physical exam, lab testing, and confirmation on high-resolution ct scan. surgical repair of the sscd or occlusion of the superior canal has been reported with a high degree of symptom resolution. sscd has been labelled the ""great otologic mimicker"" because it can simulate the symptoms of so many other ear disorders. however, the most common symptoms are vertigo/dizziness elicited by pressure altering activity, tullio's phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo), fullness/pressure in the ear and autophony.  autophony is hearing internal noises louder than would be expected, such as hearing your eyes move/blink, heart beat or joint movements. hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss can occur, mimicking otosclerosis or meniere's disease. fullness in the ear and hearing your breathing loudly in the ear are symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, but can also be found with sscd.  finally, most patients with the anatomic defect of superior semicircular canal dehiscence have no symptoms at all for some time prior to developing symptoms. sscd can affect all age groups. there are no studies looking at the demographics of sscd, however, the vast majority of patients diagnosed with sscd are adults. although the incidence of finding sscd on a scan is the same for adults and children, the incidence of symptomatic sscd in children is much less. dehiscence of bone in other parts of the otic capsule can produce similar syndromes, although they are much less common. other locations include the posterior semicircular canal, the horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea. posterior semicircular canal dehiscence is often due to a high riding jugular bulb but can also been seen with anomalies of the vestibular aqueduct, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (evas). evas, by itself can also produce symptoms similar to sscd. horizontal semicircular canal dehiscence is most frequently the result of an eroding process such as cholesteatoma. the cochlea can have bony dehiscence where it abuts the carotid artery and at the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. lastly, the bony opening where the hearing nerve enters the cochlea (at the internal auditory canal) can be abnormally wide, resulting in symptoms similar to sscd. because the condition of sscd is still fairly new (identified in 1998), it could be argued that all treatments are considered experimental or investigational.  however, the most frequently employed are surgical. surgery for sscd has included resurfacing the defect with a variety of materials, plugging the superior semicircular canal, and a combination of resurfacing and plugging. these techniques can be done through a transmastoid or a middle fossa craniotomy approach. these techniques have found great success in reducing or eliminating the vestibular symptoms of sscd. these techniques are also effective in reducing or eliminating autophony but they have not been effective in improving hearing. a lesser approach that seems to give similar benefits is reinforcement of the middle ear windows. this surgery has the advantage of being a more minimally invasive procedure but the success rate seems to be much lower with a higher recurrence rate in the long term.

document:there are seventeen species of birds that are the known carriers of and transmit west nile encephalitis (wne) to humans via the culex, aedes, and anopheles mosquitoes. wne first causes symptomatic or asymptomatic illness in wild migratory birds that act as viral replication factories. wild birds infected with wne contain high titers of the virus and remain viremic for 1-2 weeks, making them ideal hosts to perpetuate the disease. mosquitoes transmit wne from birds to humans. horses, dogs, and other small animals may harbor wne after being bitten; however, they are inefficient transmitters because viral titers are relatively low, and wne viremia is short-lived in these animals. in the us the initial cases of wne were first identified in the greater new york area, but cases have now occurred in western states. wild birds with wne virus have also been identified in parts of canada. wne is common in the middle east, asia, and africa wne seropositivity of children in egypt is approximately 50%. wne is the most common cause of viral aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in patients presenting to emergency departments in cairo. both sexes are affected equally and it is more frequent in elderly patients.

Tyrosine-Hydroxylase-Deficiency,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of disease ranging from a mild movement disorder at one end to a life-threatening, neurological disorder at the other. the symptoms of the disorder can vary widely from person to another, even among members of the same family. common symptoms include an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking (abnormal gait) and dystonia. dystonia is a general term for a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). dystonia in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency usually affects the legs. additional symptoms that may occur include tremors, eye abnormalities, and a tendency of affected children to walk on their tiptoes. the severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency causes symptoms at a very young age (first months of life). the symptoms generally do not resemble those of a movement disorder, but rather give the impression of a severe, diffuse brain disorder. mild and moderate forms of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency show dramatic improvement when treated with levodopa. levodopa is an amino acid that is converted to dopamine. dopamine is a brain chemical that serves as a neurotransmitter and is deficient in children with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. treatment options for severe tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency have been less effective. tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency occurs due to disruptions or changes (mutations) of the th gene. the th gene mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. the exact incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency in the general population is unknown. fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. researchers believe that the disorder is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase i deficiency (autosomal dominant segawa syndrome) account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of primary dystonia in childhood. tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency was first described in the medical literature in the 1970s.

Tethered-Cord-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:tethered cord syndrome is a stretch-induced functional disorder associated with the fixation (tethering) effect of inelastic tissue on the caudal spinal cord, limiting its movement. this abnormal attachment is associated with progressive stretching and increased tension of the spinal cord as a child ages, potentially resulting in a variety of neurological and other symptoms. due to the variation of the growth rate of the spinal cord and the spinal column, the progression of neurological signs and symptoms is highly variable. some individuals present with tethered cord syndrome at birth (so-called congenital), while others develop the symptomatology in infancy or early childhood. other individuals may not develop any noticeable symptoms until adulthood. although some authors call these cases acquired, the majority of these cases are mostly developmental, corresponding to the progressive development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the filum terminale. the filum terminale is a strand of tissue that bridges the spinal cord tip and the tailbone (sacrum). the inelastic structures in children originated from defective closure of the neural tube (the precursor of the spinal cord) during embryonic development, eventually forming a condition known as spina bifida. because of its functional (physiological) nature, tethered cord syndrome can be reversible if surgically treated in its early stage.

document:syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium (microorganism) treponema pallidum. it is transmitted by direct contact with an infected lesion, usually through sexual intercourse. when untreated, syphilis progresses through primary, secondary and latent stages. the early stages of syphilis may not have any detectable symptoms. in some cases, symptoms can remain dormant for years. eventually any tissue or vascular organ in the body may be affected. syphilis is caused by a bacterium (microorganism) known as treponema pallidum and acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. on rare occasions, health workers have become infected while examining affected individuals with infectious lesions. it may also be acquired by kissing someone with oral infectious lesions. infected mothers can transmit syphilis to the fetus in the womb, a condition known as congenital syphilis. (for more information on this disorder choose ""congenital syphilis"" as your search term in the rare disease database.) a diagnosis of syphilis, which is often difficult because of mild or absent symptoms in early states, is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic symptoms. blood tests may be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis, but may be difficult to interpret and often give false negative results. a physician may also obtain a small sample of tissue by scraping an ulcer or rash for microscopic study in order to determine the presence of the syphilis bacteria.

Wildervanck-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:""wildervanck syndrome, also known as cervicooculoacoustic syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects females. the disorder is characterized by a skeletal condition known as klippel-feil syndrome (kfs); abnormalities of certain eye (ocular) movements (i.e., duane syndrome); and/or hearing impairment that is present at birth (congenital). in individuals with kfs, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or """"drawing back"""" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus). in some affected individuals, additional physical abnormalities may also be present. in most cases, wildervanck syndrome appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). as mentioned above, wildervanck syndrome primarily affects females. since the disorder was originally described in 1952 (l.s. wildervanck), almost 90 cases have been reported in the medical literature. according to some reports, approximately one percent of females with hearing impairment may be affected by wildervanck syndrome. wildervanck syndrome may be detected at birth or during the first year of life based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized tests. diagnostic studies may include advanced imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (ct) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). during ct scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of internal structures. an mri uses a magnetic field and radio waves to form detailed cross-sectional images of certain organs and tissues. such techniques may help to detect and characterize abnormalities of the inner ear, union or fusion of certain bones of the spinal column (e.g., cervical vertebrae), possible impingement of vertebrae on the spinal cord, or other abnormalities potentially associated with the disorder. in addition, in some individuals with wildervanck syndrome, exploratory surgery may be conducted to detect malformations of the middle ear (exploratory tympanotomy). additional specialized tests may also be performed to confirm or characterize other abnormalities that may be associated with the disorder (e.g., certain ocular findings, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities, etc.).""

document:spastic paraplegia 50 (spg50) is a slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorder that generally presents with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, small head size (microcephaly), seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. hypotonia (low-muscle tone) develops into hypertonia (high-muscle tone), resulting in spasticity of the legs that leads to non-ambulation and wheelchair reliance. spasticity may progress to the upper extremities, leading to the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso (tetraplegia). ap-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (hsp) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. the conditions included in this group are spg47, spg50, spg51 and spg52 and all have similar symptoms. these conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. since many of the initial clinical manifestations of spg50 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. this may include a brain mri showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. a definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.

Zollinger,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:zollinger-ellison syndrome (zes) is characterized by the development of a tumor (gastrinoma) or tumors that secrete excessive levels of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates production of acid by the stomach. many affected individuals develop multiple gastrinomas, which are thought to have the potential to be cancerous (malignant). in most patients, the tumors arise within the pancreas and/or the upper region of the small intestine (duodenum). due to excessive acid production (gastric acid hypersecretion), individuals with zes may develop peptic ulcers of the stomach, the duodenum, and/or other regions of the digestive tract. peptic ulcers are sores or raw areas within the digestive tract where the lining has been eroded by stomach acid and digestive juices. symptoms and findings associated with zes may include mild to severe abdominal pain; diarrhea; increased amounts of fat in the stools (steatorrhea); and/or other abnormalities. in most affected individuals, zes appears to develop randomly (sporadically) for unknown reasons. in approximately 25 percent of patients, zes occurs in association with a genetic syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men-1). all of the tumors are considered to have malignant potential. prognosis is related to tumor size and the presence of distant metastases. zes may become apparent at any age. however, symptom onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 60 years. the exact frequency of zes in the general population is unknown. however, some researchers estimate that zes represents less than one percent of peptic ulcers.

Triploidy,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:triploidy is a rare chromosomal abnormality. triploidy is the presence of an additional set of chromosomes in the cell for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46 chromosomes per cell. the extra set of chromosomes originates either from the father or the mother during fertilization. infants with triploidy usually are miscarried early in the pregnancy. if the pregnancy continues to term, the infant dies within the first days of life. a few affected individuals have been reported to have survived to adulthood, but suffered from developmental delay, learning difficulties, seizures, hearing loss and other abnormalities. those that survive have mosaic triploidy, meaning that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other cells have 69 chromosomes per cell.  infants affected with complete triploidy suffer from growth restriction and multiple birth defects. triploidy is the presence of a complete additional set of chromosomes. the triplication of the chromosomes is caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperms, or the fertilization of an egg by a sperm that has an extra set of chromosomes or by the fertilization of an egg that has an extra set of chromosomes by a normal sperm. this disorder does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. triploidy accounts for 1-3 percent of all pregnancies. the condition occurs slightly more often in males than females; it is estimated that 2/3 of triploid pregnancies are male. the presence of multiple major malformations, low amniotic fluid and/or growth restriction on fetal ultrasound during pregnancy raises the suspicion of triploidy. the diagnosis can be made during pregnancy by chromosome analysis (karyotyping) of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (cvs). the diagnosis can be confirmed after birth by chromosome analysis of tissue (skin) obtained from the affected infant. triploidy cannot be diagnosed by chromosome microarray testing. the accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal (cff) dna in the diagnosis of triploidy is still being studied. abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol and pregnancy-assisted plasma protein-a have been associated with an increased risk for triploidy.

document:tangier disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins (hdl) in the blood. hdl-cholesterol (hdl-c) is often referred to as the ""good cholesterol"" as it can facilitate the removal of cholesterol out of the walls of arteries, particularly the coronary (heart) arteries. classic features of tangier disease include fatty accumulations that present as enlarged and yellow- or orange-colored tonsils, or enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes. tangier disease may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, moderate elevation in triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), nerve disturbances (neuropathy), and rarely an opaqueness in the covering of the eye (corneal clouding). this disorder was originally named after the location in which it was first discovered - tangier island in the chesapeake bay. later, the disease was further characterized as more individuals were found to have the disease in other areas of the united states and around the globe. symptoms of tangier disease are variable and depend on which organs are involved and the severity of those manifestations. tangier disease is most often characterized by enlarged orange- or yellow-colored tonsils. this discoloration is due to fatty deposits accumulating in the tonsils. fatty deposits can also form in other organs causing enlargement of the throat, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. fat accumulations in nerves can cause disturbances and loss-of-sensation called peripheral neuropathy. discoloration may also occur in the digestive system, particularly the rectum and large intestine. cardiovascular disease has been reported in adults with tangier disease. in rare cases, a clouding of the cornea of the eye can occur, but is generally mild and does not cause vision impairment. tangier disease is a rare disorder with only approximately 100 cases diagnosed worldwide. tangier disease is thought to be present at birth, but the age of diagnosis can be highly variable (from infancy through 7th decade) due to the nature of symptoms.

Sweet-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:sweet syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by fever and the sudden onset of a rash, which consists of multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps or lesions. these lesions usually occur on the arms, legs, trunk, face or neck. in some cases, additional systems of the body can become involved including the musculoskeletal system such as inflammation of the joints (arthritis), the eyes such as inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs. in the majority of affected individuals, the disorder occurs by itself for no known reason (idiopathic sweet syndrome); this is also known as classical sweet syndrome. less often, the disorder can be associated with an underlying cancer (malignancy), usually a blood (hematologic) cancer such as certain types of leukemia; this is known as malignancy-associated sweet syndrome. the disorder can also result as a reaction to taking certain drugs, especially a drug known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; this is known as drug-induced sweet syndrome. sweet syndrome is treated with corticosteroids. classical sweet syndrome in adults affects women more often than men by as much as 15:1 by some estimates. this female preponderance has not been seen in malignancy-associated or drug-induced sweet syndrome. classical sweet syndrome usually affects women between the ages of 30-50, but can be seen in individuals of any age including children. there is no gender predominance seen in children. several hundred individuals of sweet syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. only approximately 80 children have been reported in the medical literature. a diagnosis of sweet syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. in many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue may reveal the infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis. a complete blood cell count may also show neutrophils in the blood (neutrophilia).

Sudden-Infant-Death-Syndrome,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:sudden infant death syndrome (sids) is the sudden death of an infant under the age of 1 year that remains unexplained after careful review of the history, death scene investigation, and thorough autopsy. in 2008, the most recent published data from the national vital statistics system indicated that sids was listed as the third leading cause of death in infants in the united states. causes of sids are considered to be multifactorial. the triple risk hypothesis describes the presence of three risk factors that, when overlapping, predispose a baby to sids. these include an environmental trigger/stress, a critical developmental period, and an underlying vulnerability. physician-scientists and scientists are studying neuropathological tissue and genetic material from sids victims to ascertain factors that might be responsible for heightening an infant's vulnerability to sids. others are performing physiologic studies on infants known to have an increased risk for sids. basic scientists are studying animal models that might provide insight into mechanisms responsible for sids. current clinical management targets improving education for families and caregivers regarding known modifiable environmental stressors (risk factors) (see below). there are typically no symptoms prior to a sids death. though sids occurs during sleep, the deaths may occur during day or night time sleep. existing literature does not indicate any evidence for suffering by the infant in the moments preceding the sudden death. sids can affect all infants under 1 year of age. most deaths occur less than 6 months of age with the peak affected age between 2 and 4 months. gender, ethnic and racial differences also exist. for example, boys are at greater risk for sids than girls. also, the sids rate in african american infants is 2.7 times greater than the caucasian rate in the us. likewise, sids rates are increased in the american indians and alaskan natives as compared to caucasians. these differences may reflect both cultural practices and genetic variations. sids is a diagnosis of exclusion which means that it is only determined as the cause of death after thorough investigation of clinical history, scene of death, and autopsy reveal no other cause.

Urachal-Cancer,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:urachal cancer is a form of cancer that arises in a structure called the urachus. the urachus is a canal that exists when the fetus is developing before birth. this canal runs from the bladder of the fetus to the belly button (umbilicus). it drains the urinary bladder of the fetus. between the fourth and fifth month of pregnancy, this canal breaks down (degenerates) into a fibrous band of tissue called a ligament. this ligament runs from the belly button to the top of the bladder and is called the median umbilical ligament. sometimes, there are tissue remnants of the urachus in adults (about 1/3 of adults have urachal tissue remnants). this usually does not cause any problems. however, sometimes these remnants can potentially become cancerous (malignant). urachal cancer will often extend into surrounding structures like the bladder, and can potentially spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. the exact, underlying cause of urachal cancer is not fully understood. surgery is the most common treatment option. urachal cancer is a rare disorder. the exact prevalence and incidence of this form of cancer in the general population is unknown. rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. urachal cancer accounts for less than 1% of bladder cancers. males and females are affected. most people are in their 40-50s when diagnosed with the disorder.

document:systemic capillary leak syndrome (scls) is a rare acquired disorder characterized by acute and severe recurrent attacks associated with a rapid fall in blood pressure. attacks often last several days and require emergency care. they are sometimes fatal. scls occurs most often in adults and the disease is very rare in children. scls is not hereditary. more than one half of patients have a monoclonal or m protein detected in the blood. the level of m protein is usually low.  the m protein is produced by what usually amount to small numbers of plasma cells in the marrow.   the m protein itself does not appear to cause the attacks. many possible explanations have been offered including an autoimmune mechanism. recently it has been suggested that capillary lining cells may be damaged by a factor in the blood, which is produced during the acute attack.  scls has been recognized in a range of racial backgrounds and nationalities. although the cause of scls is not yet known, there appears to be no genetic predisposition to the disease. there are less than 100 patients reported in the world literature since its first description in 1960 by clarkson. scls seems to occur more often in males and older adults. the disease may be more frequent than the literature suggests because the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. scls may be mistaken for a severe infection such as septic shock or toxic shock syndrome.  some features such as the swelling may lead one to suspect heart failure or kidney disease. c-1 esterase inhibitor deficiency syndrome may present with a type of recurring edema called angioedema and is often thought of in patients presenting with scls. in some cases the hemoconcentration and resulting high hematocrit and hemoglobin level have been mistaken for polycythemia.

document:tolosa-hunt syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe periorbital headaches, along with decreased and painful eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). symptoms usually affect only one eye (unilateral). in most cases, affected individuals experience intense sharp pain and decreased eye movements. symptoms often will subside without intervention (spontaneous remission) and may recur without a distinct pattern (randomly). affected individuals may exhibit signs of paralysis (palsy) of certain cranial nerves such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. the affected eye often abnormally protrudes (proptosis). the exact cause of tolosa-hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). while the exact cause of tolosa-hunt syndrome is unknown, one theory is an abnormal autoimmune response linked with an inflammation in a specific area behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). in some cases, inflammation may be due to a clumping of a certain type of cell (granulomatous inflammation). autoimmune disorders are caused when the body's natural defenses against ""foreign"" or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. other possible causes may include generalized inflammation and constricted or inflamed cranial blood vessels. tolosa-hunt syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs in males and females in equal numbers. the average age of onset is 41 years, but there have been cases reported among people younger than age 30. in rare cases, children under the age of 10 have been diagnosed with tolosa-hunt syndrome.

Tongue-Cancer,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:tongue cancers are oral cancers that are differentiated by their location in the mouth and on the tongue. if the cancer is on the forward portion of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer of the oral tongue. if the cancer is located towards the rear third of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer at the base of the tongue. tongue cancer is most common in men over age 60.  it is rare in people, particularly women, under age 40. examination of a sample of tissue from the site of the suspected cancer by a qualified pathologist is the key to diagnosis. mri and/or cat scans may be ordered to determine the location and size of the growth. this examination will also determine the stage of the disorder (how advanced it may be), which in turn, will help determine the method and pace of treatment.

Zellweger-Spectrum-Disorders,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of rare, genetic, multisystem disorders that were once thought to be separate entities. these disorders are now classified as different expressions (variants) of one disease process. collectively, they form a spectrum or continuum of disease. zellweger syndrome is the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy is the intermediate form; and infantile refsum disease is the mildest form. zellweger spectrum disorders can affect most organs of the body. neurological deficits, loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), hearing loss, vision problems, liver dysfunction, and kidney abnormalities are common findings. zellweger spectrum disorders often result in severe, life-threatening complications early during infancy. some individuals with milder forms have lived into adulthood. zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. zellweger spectrum disorders are also known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders (pbds) - a group of disorders characterized by the failure of the body to produce peroxisomes that function properly. peroxisomes are very small, membrane-bound structures within the gel-like fluid (cytoplasm) of cells that play a vital role in numerous biochemical processes in the body. pbds are subdivided into the three zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.  zellweger spectrum disorders are usually apparent at birth. they affect individuals of all ethnic groups. in the united states, the combined incidence of these disorders is at least 1 in 50,000 live births. because some cases go undiagnosed, determining these disorders true frequency in the general population is difficult.

Yellow-Fever,"instruction:as a relation extractor assistant, identify the relations in this document. do not generate any tokens outside of the document.
document:yellow fever is a viral infection that causes damage to the liver, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal tract. major symptoms may include sudden onset of fever, yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and hemorrhage. it occurs predominately in south america, the caribbean islands and africa. the disease is spread through bites of infected mosquitos. incidence of the disease tends to increase in the summer as the mosquito population increases, and it occurs year round in tropical climates. yellow fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite by an infected mosquito. initially, a mosquito acquires the disease by ingesting the blood of an infected host.  the mosquito then transmits the infection to its next bite victim. yellow fever affects males and females equally. people living in semitropical or tropical climates are at risk unless they are vaccinated against this infection. people in southern areas of the united states, living near marshes and swamps may be at risk during the summer months. however, most cases of yellow fever occur in africa and south america. the treatment of yellow fever is symptomatic and supportive. preventative measures consist of mosquito control and a vaccine that prevents development of the infection. immunity from a vaccination usually develops after 10 days and lasts for more than 10 years. in some cases, side effects associated with vaccination may occur five to 10 days later. these side effects affect approximately 5 percent of individuals receiving immunization and may include headache, fever, and/or aching muscles.
